Setup:

* DB is "wordpress-bibcite-sc" on localhost
* phpMyAdmin is "root" / no password
* Switched Wamp64 to PHP 7 (requirement for anonymous classes)
* WP install is D:/wamp64/www/wordpress-bibcite-sc
* Wordpress is "admin" / "password"

Add admin settings and features:

* Citation styles and where to find them
	* Citation mode: 
		* bibliography entry style and list template
		* entry note style and entry template		
	* Biblography mode: entry style and list template
	* If there a bibliography available, let the user render one of the entries
* Test and update params on all shortcodes
* URL(s) of bibliographies
	* Add the ability to upload files directly? Store in a separate dir and check dates/times periodically? Can probably use the same logic as for a remote file. Might be worth having multiple Bibcite_Library instances w/ backed either by a URL or file, and with derived/specialised download/check cache date mechanisms.
* Local no-download time
* Clear all cached data
* Log level
* Show log

Features:

* Rename files/classes
* Go through all code:
	* Run phpfmt (via extension)?
	* Refactoring: can anything be done better or more reliably?
	* Installation, activation, deactivation, uninstallation?
* Detect CSL or RIS input libraries
* Add user-specified CSL style directory

* How to deal w/ braces around titles?
* Add OrkneyDullard\Converter to travisci.org?
* Create pull request on the main repo?
