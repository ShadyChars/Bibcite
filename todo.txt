Setup:

* DB is "wordpress-bibcite-sc" on localhost
* phpMyAdmin is "root" / no password
* Switched Wamp64 to PHP 7 (requirement for anonymous classes)
* WP install is D:/wamp64/www/wordpress-bibcite-sc
* Wordpress is "admin" / "password"

Settings and features:

* Reset:
	* Rename to "delete cache"
	* Add "delete cache" hook + implementations
	* Add "delete cache" button to settings
* Move to CSL storage in the DB - IN PROGRESS
* Citation styles and where to find them
	* Citation mode: 
		* bibliography entry style and list template - DONE
		* entry note style and entry template - DONE
	* Biblography mode: entry style and list template - DONE
	* If there a bibliography available, let the user render one of the entries
* Test and update params on all shortcodes
* URL(s) of bibliographies
	* Add the ability to upload files directly? Store in a separate dir and check dates/times periodically? Can probably use the same logic as for a remote file. Might be worth having multiple Bibcite_SC_Library instances w/ backed either by a URL or file, and with derived/specialised download/check cache date mechanisms.
* Local no-download time
* Log level
* Show log
* Detect CSL or RIS input libraries
* Add user-specified CSL style directory
