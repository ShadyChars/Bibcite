Setup:

* DB is "wordpress-bibcite-sc" on localhost
* phpMyAdmin is "root" / no password
* Switched Wamp64 to PHP 7 (requirement for anonymous classes)
* WP install is D:/wamp64/www/wordpress-bibcite-sc
* Wordpress is "admin" / "password"

To do:

* Move logging into dedicated Bibcite_Logger class - DONE
* Add logging to existing methods to track lifecycle - DONE
* Work out how to download, load, parse and cache a Bibtex file - IN PROGRESS
* Define download / file / caching behaviour - IN PROGRESS
	* Need to work out how to use local files, if available.

Add admin settings:

* URL(s) of bibliographies
	* Add the ability to upload files directly? Store in a separate dir and check dates/times periodically? Can probably use the same logic as for a remote file. Might be worth having multiple Bibcite_Library instances w/ backed either by a URL or file, and with derived/specialised download/check cache date mechanisms.
* Local cache time
* Log level
* Show log
