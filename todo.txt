Setup:

* DB is "wordpress-bibcite-sc" on localhost
* phpMyAdmin is "root" / no password
* Switched Wamp64 to PHP 7 (requirement for anonymous classes)
* WP install is D:/wamp64/www/wordpress-bibcite-sc
* Wordpress is "admin" / "password"

Add admin settings:

* Citation styles and where to find them
* Citation mode: 
	* entry note style and entry template
	* bibliography entry style and list template
* Biblography mode: entry style and list template
* URL(s) of bibliographies
	* Add the ability to upload files directly? Store in a separate dir and check dates/times periodically? Can probably use the same logic as for a remote file. Might be worth having multiple Bibcite_Library instances w/ backed either by a URL or file, and with derived/specialised download/check cache date mechanisms.
* Local no-download time
* Clear all cached data
* Log level
* Show log

Features:

* Detect CSL or RIS input libraries

OrkneyDullard/converter

* How to deal w/ braces around titles?
* Add OrkneyDullard\Converter to travisci.org?
* Create pull request on the main repo?
