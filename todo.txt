Setup:

* DB is "wordpress-bibcite-sc" on localhost
* phpMyAdmin is "root" / no password
* Switched Wamp64 to PHP 7 (requirement for anonymous classes)
* WP install is D:/wamp64/www/wordpress-bibcite-sc
* Wordpress is "admin" / "password"

To do:

* Move logging into dedicated Bibcite_Logger class - DONE
* Add logging to existing methods to track lifecycle - DONE
* Work out how to download, load, parse and cache a Bibtex file - DONE
* Refactor library access, downloading, parsing and storage:
	* Bibcite_Downloader should obtain and save an up-to-date version of a remote Bibtex file - DONE
	* Bibcite_Parser should parse a local Bibtex file and make available a list of entries - DONE
	* Bibcite_Library should manage creation, insertion into, access to and deletion from a database of Bibtex strings - DONE		
	* Shortcode methods should use these classes to manage bibliography output. - IN PROGRESS
		* Fix Geissler\Converter - DONE
		* Test Geissler + CiteProc w/ the complete bibliography from Mendeley - IN PROGRESS
			* How to deal with escaped Bibtex titles? - DONE
			* Add OrkneyDullard\Converter to travisci.org?
			* Create pull request on the main repo?		
		* What shortcodes / styles of citation do I need to support? Look at posts and "elsewhere" page.
		* How to generate note links? Does this need to be stylable/templatable?
		* Render the bibliography - what style?

Add admin settings:

* URL(s) of bibliographies
	* Add the ability to upload files directly? Store in a separate dir and check dates/times periodically? Can probably use the same logic as for a remote file. Might be worth having multiple Bibcite_Library instances w/ backed either by a URL or file, and with derived/specialised download/check cache date mechanisms.
* Local cache time
* Log level
* Show log
* Support CSL or RIS input libraries.
