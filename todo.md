# Todo

## Prepare for upload

* Fix Monolog bug - **DONE**
* Rename to Bibcite-CSL
* Update version to 2.0.0
* Replace "bibtex" cache location w/ something more generic - can I use Zotero remotely?
  
## Future

* Replace "bibtex", "bibshow" etc. as shortcodes - but retain older ones too for backwards compatibility
* Review settings - can this be simplified?
  * Esp templating - is this really necessary? Can we use CiteProc for footnoted styles?
* Improve tests - compare to HTML rendered Zotero items, for example
* Update readme
* Merge back to master
* Post about this!
