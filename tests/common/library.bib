@incollection{Drower1995,
abstract = {Flinders Petrie has been called the “Father of Modern Egyptology”—and indeed he is one of the pioneers of modern archaeological methods. This fascinating biography of Petrie was first published to high acclaim in England in 1985. Margaret S. Drower, a student of Petrie's in the early 1930s, traces his life from his boyhood, when he was already a budding scholar, through his stunning career in the deserts of Egypt to his death in Jerusalem at the age of eighty-nine. Drower combines her first-hand knowledge with Petrie's own voluminous personal and professional diaries to forge a lively account of this influential and sometimes controversial figure. Drower presents Petrie as he was: an enthusiastic eccentric, diligently plunging into the uncharted past of ancient Egypt. She tells not only of his spectacular finds, including the tombs of the first Pharaohs, the earliest alphabetic script, a Homer manuscript, and a collection of painted portraits on mummy cases, but also of Petrie's important contributions to the science of modern archaeology, such as orderly record-keeping of the progress of a dig and the use of pottery sherds in historical dating. Petrie's careful academic methods often pitted him against such rival archaeologists as Am{\'{e}}lineau, who boasted he had smashed the stone jars he could not carry away to be sold, and Maspero and Naville, who mangled a pyramid at El Kula they had vainly tried to break into.},

@book{Michelson2006WrittenTwain,
abstract = {Trained as a printer when still a boy, and thrilled throughout his life by the automation of printing and the headlong expansion of American publishing, Mark Twain wrote about the consequences of this revolution for culture and for personal identity. Printer's Devil is the first book to explore these themes in some of Mark Twain's best-known literary works, and in his most daring speculations--on American society, the modern condition, and the nature of the self. Playfully and anxiously, Mark Twain often thought about typeset words and published images as powerful forces--for political and moral change, personal riches and ruin, and epistemological turmoil. In his later years, Mark Twain wrote about the printing press as a center of metaphysical power, a force that could alter the fabric of reality. Studying these themes in Mark Twain's writings, Bruce Michelson also provides a fascinating overview of technological changes that transformed the American printing and publishing industries during Twain's lifetime, changes that opened new possibilities for content, for speed of production, for the size and diversity of a potential audience, and for international fame. The story of Mark Twain's life and art, amid this media revolution, is a story with powerful implications for our own time, as we ride another wave of radical change: for printed texts, authors, truth, and consciousness.},

@article{Zipkin2014,
abstract = {Experimental studies of hafting adhesives and modifications to compound tool components can demonstrate the extent to which human ancestors understood and exploited material properties only formally defined by science within the last century. Discoveries of Stone Age hafting adhesives at archaeological sites in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa have spurred experiments that sought to replicate or create models of such adhesives. Most of these studies, however, have been actualistic in design, focusing on replicating ancient applications of adhesive technology. In contrast, this study tested several glues based on Acacia resin within a materials science framework to better understand the effect of each adhesive ingredient on compound tool durability. Using an overlap joint as a model for a compound tool, adhesives formulated with loading agents from a range of particle sizes and mineral compositions were tested for toughness on smooth and rough substrates. Our results indicated that overlap joint toughness is significantly increased by using a roughened joint surface. Contrary to some previous studies, there was no evidence that particle size diversity in a loading agent improved adhesive effectiveness. Generally, glues containing quartz or ochre loading agents in the silt and clay-sized particle class yielded the toughest overlap joints, with the effect of particle size found to be more significant for rough rather than smooth substrate joints. Additionally, no particular ochre mineral or mineral mixture was found to be a clearly superior loading agent. These two points taken together suggest that Paleolithic use of ochre-loaded adhesives and the criteria used to select ochres for this purpose may have been mediated by visual and symbolic considerations rather than purely functional concerns.},

They are so well suited to the underlying language, one of the Afroasiatic group, that their creation seems to be deliberate.

abstract = {In the Middle Ages, textual amulets--short texts written on parchment or paper and worn on the body--were thought to protect the bearer against enemies, to heal afflictions caused by demonic invasions, and to bring the wearer good fortune. In Binding Words, Don C. Skemer provides the first book-length study of this once-common means of harnessing the magical power of words. Textual amulets were a unique source of empowerment, promising the believer safe passage through a precarious world by means of an ever-changing mix of scriptural quotations, divine names, common prayers, and liturgical formulas. Although theologians and canon lawyers frequently derided textual amulets as ignorant superstition, many literate clergy played a central role in producing and disseminating them. The texts were, in turn, embraced by a broad cross-section of Western Europe. Saints and parish priests, physicians and village healers, landowners and peasants alike believed in their efficacy. Skemer offers careful analysis of several dozen surviving textual amulets along with other contemporary medieval source materials. In the process, Binding Words enriches our understanding of popular religion and magic in everyday medieval life.},

abstract = {Several animal species use tools for foraging, such as sticks to extract embedded arthropods and honey, or stones to crack open nuts and eggs. While providing access to nutritious foods, these behaviours may incur significant costs, such as the time and energy spent searching for, manufacturing and transporting tools. These costs can be reduced by re-using tools, keeping them safe when not needed. We experimentally investigated what New Caledonian crows do with their tools between successive prey extractions, and whether they express tool 'safekeeping' behaviours more often when the costs (foraging at height), or likelihood (handling of demanding prey), of tool loss are high. Birds generally took care of their tools (84% of 176 prey extractions, nine subjects), either trapping them underfoot (74%) or storing them in holes (26%)—behaviours we also observed in the wild (19 cases, four subjects). Moreover, tool-handling behaviour was context-dependent, with subjects: keeping their tools safe significantly more often when foraging at height; and storing tools significantly more often in holes when extracting more demanding prey (under these conditions, foot-trapping proved challenging). In arboreal environments, safekeeping can prevent costly tool losses, removing a potentially important constraint on the evolution of habitual and complex tool behaviour.},

@book{McMains2000,
abstract = {For centuries, rumors have circulated in England that Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell did not die of natural causes. Now, in a fascinating book that reads like a historical whodunit, we have a motive, a means, a murderer (complete with his own deathbed confession), and a supporting cast that includes John Milton and Andrew Marvell. Almost from the moment of Cromwell's death in 1658, writers and biographers have dismissed suspicions of foul play as little more than the result of a powerful person's unexpected demise. They have assumed that at age fifty-nine Cromwell was in generally poor health and that his government's collapse was inevitable. But his family was generally long-lived and, contrary to royalist wishes, his government was becoming established. As the crucial first step toward the restoration of the Stuart monarchy in 1660, his death proved to be a turning point in British history. In a wide-ranging investigation that draws upon the fields of history, toxicology, medical forensics, and literature, H.F. McMains offers a fresh reading of evidence that has sat quietly in libraries and archives for more than two centuries. He examines the development of Cromwell's illness in 1658, analyzes his symptoms, and evaluates persons with motive, method, and opportunity to do him harm. The result is a reassessment of Cromwell's relationship with the English people and their government and a convincing investigation of his mysterious death.},

Salv{\'{a}} presented his electric telegraph to the Academy of Sciences at Barcelona, Spain, in 22 February 1804, and left his thoughts written in a not very well known essay titled: 'Second Report about Galvanism as applied to Telegraphy' which will serve as the basis for this paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

abstract = {This book provides a complete, comparative, nongallocentric account of nasality in all the Romance languages. It demonstrates the central role of nasality in the history of sound changes in the languages of southern Europe. In doing so, it assembles a large amount of important philological and linguistic data previously dispersed and difficult to access, and organizes it in a way that allows the author (and will allow the reader) to analyse it systematically. Two introductory chapters discuss general principles of nasality and Romance nasalization. Subsequent chapters are then devoted to each language. The author considers all the standard varieties and a substantial range of non-standard varieties, and identifies broad characteristics of vowel nasalization in Romance. In the the final chapter he makes a clear bridge between the data-rich discussion of individual languages and the isolation of language universals. This is will be the standard work in its field for many years. It will be of central interest to linguists and philologists of Romance, as well as to those concerned more generally to understand the causes, patterns, and processes of sound change.},

abstract = {{In this biography Anthony Everitt brings to life the world of ancient Rome in its glorious heyday. Cicero squared off against Caesar and was friends with young Brutus. He advised Pompey on his botched transition from military hero to politician. He lambasted Mark Antony and was the master of the smear campaign, as feared for his wit as he was for exposing his opponents' sexual peccadilloes. Brilliant, voluble, cranky, a terrible gossip, and a genius of political manipulation, Cicero was Rome's most revered politician, one of the greatest statesmen of all time. Accessible to us through unguarded letters written to his best friend, Atticus, Cicero emerges as a witty and resourceful political manipulator, the most eloquent witness to the last days of Republican Rome.}},

annote = {There is a great difference in the breadth of the various kinds of paper. That of best quality1 is thirteen fingers wide, while the hieratica is two fingers less. The Fanniana is ten fingers wide, and that known as "amphitheatrica," one less. The Saitic is of still smaller breadth, indeed it is not so wide as the mallet with which the paper is beaten; and the emporetica is particularly narrow, being not more than six fingers in breadth.In addition to the above particulars, paper is esteemed according to its fineness, its stoutness, its whiteness, and its smoothness. Claudius C{\ae}sar effected a change in that which till then had been looked upon as being of the first quality: for the Augustan paper had been found to be so remarkably fine, as to offer no resistance to the pressure of the pen; in addition to which, as it allowed the writing upon it to run through, it was continually causing apprehensions of its being blotted and blurred by the writing on the other side; the remarkable transparency, too, of the paper was very unsightly to the eye. To obviate these inconveniences, a groundwork of paper was made with leaves of the second quality, over which was laid a woof, as it were, formed of leaves of the first. He increased the width also of paper; the width [of the common sort] being made a foot, and that of the size known as "macrocollum,"2 a cubit; though one inconvenience was soon detected in it, for, upon a single leaf3 being torn in the press, more pages were apt to be spoilt than before.4 In consequence of the advantages above-mentioned, the Claudian has come to be preferred to all other kinds of paper, though the Augustan is still used for the purposes of epistolary correspondence. The Livian, which had nothing in common with that of first quality, but was entirely of a secondary rank, still holds its former place.1 Augustan.2 Or "long glued" paper: the breadth probably consisted of that of two or more sheets glued or pasted at the edges, the seam running down the roll.
3 Scheda. One of the leaves of the papyrus, of which the roll of twenty, joined side by side, was formed.
4 This passage is difficult to be understood, and various attempts have been made to explain it. It is not unlikely that his meaning is that the breadth being doubled, the tearing of one leaf or half breadth entailed of necessity the spoiling of another, making the corresponding half breadth.},

The precursors of the first printers in Belgium and France were not the university stationers but the organized scriptoria which produced vernacular texts for the French-speaking aristocracy. Colard Mansion of Bruges was, throughout his life, both a printer and a scribe. His principal patron, Louis of Bruges, had one of the largest aristocratic libraries of manuscript books. Mansion circulated some of his original literary works only as deluxe manuscripts. He introduced copper engraving for the exact duplication of miniature illustrations. The size of his printed editions was comparable to the size of contemporary manuscript editions. Colard Mansion sought not to supplant the scribal arts but to perfect them. Printing became a source of dramatic social and intellectual change only after Colard Mansion's death.},

abstract = {To give priority to military and freight traffic in wartime, the British government tried to impose restrictions on civilian travel and ran a dissuasive poster campaign. It also encouraged local authorities and others to provide home-grown entertainment - Holidays at Home. This article looks at their origins and at how such ersatz holidays were received. It draws on published and unpublished accounts, including those of Mass-Observation observers, government information officers, local newspaper reports and interviews with those who lived in Swindon, the author's home town, during the war. Finally, it deals with the way in which Holidays at Home were predicted to continue postwar.},

@incollection{Danesi2017EmojiAndWritingSystems,
abstract = {Emoji have gone from being virtually unknown to being a central topic in internet communication. What is behind the rise and rise of these winky faces, clinking glasses and smiling poos? Given the sheer variety of verbal communication on the internet and English's still-controversial role as lingua mundi for the web, these icons have emerged as a compensatory universal language. The Semiotics of Emoji looks at what is officially the world's fastest-growing form of communication. Emoji, the colourful symbols and glyphs that represent everything from frowning disapproval to red-faced shame, are fast becoming embedded into digital communication. Controlled by a centralized body and regulated across the web, emoji seems to be a language: but is it? The rapid adoption of emoji in such a short span of time makes it a rich study in exploring the functions of language. Professor Marcel Danesi, an internationally-known expert in semiotics, branding and communication, answers the pertinent questions. Are emoji making us dumber? Can they ultimately replace language? Will people grow up emoji literate as well as digitally native? Can there be such a thing as a Universal Visual Language? Read this book for the answers.-- Emoji and writing systems -- Emoji uses -- Emoji competence -- Emoji semantics -- Emoji grammar -- Emoji pragmatics -- Emoji variation -- Emoji spread -- Universal languages -- A communication revolution?},

He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians.

abstract = {We often take punctuation for granted, but its evolution has been largely responsible for our ability to communicate meaning and convey emphasis with the written word. Believing that the best way to understand usage is to study it historically, Parkes focuses on how marks have actually been used. He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians. It is destined to become a standard reference work for anyone interested in the history and use of language.},

abstract = {The mathematical table, as a paper-based artefact, is close to the end of its technological life. Tables had two main uses — as a calculating aid (such as a logarithm table) and as a data storage device (such as an actuarial or census table). Logarithmic tables have now been made obsolete by the electronic calculator, while data tables are increasingly being replaced by online databases. Examples of these uses of tables have been given in several of the previous chapters. The decline in the use of tables was much in evidence before the arrival of the electronic spreadsheet on the scene, and by and large the spreadsheet has not taken over these functions of the table. Yet, the perception of the spreadsheet as an historical successor to the table is intuitive and appealing. This chapter considers the sense in which this can be said to be true.},

abstract = {This book traces the intellectual life of the Kingdom of Italy, the area in which humanism began in the mid-thirteenth century, a century or more before exerting its influence on the rest of Europe. Covering a period of over four and a half centuries, this study offers the first integrated analysis of Latin writings produced in the area, examining not only religious, literary, and legal texts. Ronald G. Witt characterizes the changes reflected in these Latin writings as products of the interaction of thought with economic, political, and religious tendencies in Italian society as well as with intellectual influences coming from abroad. His research ultimately traces the early emergence of humanism in northern Italy in the mid-thirteenth century to the precocious development of a lay intelligentsia in the region, whose participation in the culture of Latin writing fostered the beginnings of the intellectual movement which would eventually revolutionize all of Europe.},

annote = {Federal agents have recovered in Virginia a rare first-edition of the Book of Mormon, believed to have been stolen from a downtown Mesa, Ariz., bookstore over the Memorial Day weekend, the FBI's Washington field office said Thursday.
The book, considered to be the sacred text of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, was taken from a rare books and art store owned by 88-year-old Helen Spencer Schlie, who once filled in as a substitute Sunday school teacher in Bloomfield Hills., Mich., for Mitt Romney, now the Republican presidential hopeful.
FBI officials said the bureau assisted in the recovery of the book at the request of the Mesa Police Department through the FBI's Art Theft Program.
Jay Michael Linford, 48, of Gilbert, Ariz., and of Palmyra, N.Y., was arrested June 12 at the apartment of a friend in Herndon, where he was staying. A search warrant recovered the book, first published in 1830. The friend was not implicated in the suspected theft.
Mr. Linford currently is in custody and awaiting extradition to Arizona, where he faces charges of theft and trafficking in stolen property. He is accused of taking the book from the Rare and Out of Date Print Books and Art Store in Mesa.
In a telephone interview with The Washington Times, Mrs. Schlie said Mr. Linford was her publisher, trusted friend and also a member of the Mormon Church. She said she bought the book in the 1960s and that several people have since asked to have their picture taken with it because of its significance to the church.
She said she reported it stolen after discovering it missing from a fireproofed but unlocked cabinet in her store. Her store is one block from the Mormon Temple in Mesa.
“The news of the book's recovery has been both good and bad,” she said, referring to the arrest of someone she trusted. “But I do have great relief. I am glad that I will soon have it back. I've had the book for decades.”
She said she was a member of the same LDS Ward in Michigan when Mr. Romney was 15, and was friends with his mother. Asked about his run for the presidency, she said she was “delighted.”
Valued at between $30,000 and $40,000, the book is one of 5,000 copies printed in 1830.
There were early reports that Mr. Linford may have sold some pages out of the 588-page, leather-bound book to a Dallas area book dealer. He is being held at the Fairfax County Detention Facility on $40,000 bond pending extradition to Arizona.
The LDS faithful believe the Book of Mormon was transcribed from golden plates given to the prophet Joseph Smith in 1827 by an angel named Moroni as evidence of the restoration of Christ's true church in the latter days.
Ironically, Palmyra, N.Y., where Mr. Linder has a business known as Experience Press, is considered the birthplace of the Mormon Church and where Smith lived and is believed to have received the golden plates. It also is where the first Book of Mormon was published.
In addition to the Mesa Police Department, the FBI investigation was conducted in partnership with the Herndon Police Department, the U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, and the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Eastern District of Virginia.
The FBI's Art Theft Program is a rapid deployment team consisting of 14 agents assigned to various field offices throughout the United States, including Washington. To date, the team has recovered more than 2,650 items valued at over $150 million.},

@article{Wassmann1994,
abstract = {The starting point of this study is the apparent contradiction between the existence in Yupno (Papua New Guinea) culture of an elaborate number system and the lack of importance attributed to counting in everyday life. The study is designed to answer two questions: To what extent is the model described by the socially most prestigious expert shared by other Yupno men? How can the system be used to solve new, unfamiliar problems? Indeed, the variability found in the description and use of the number system is very important, to the extent where almost each subject uses it in a slightly different, idiosyncratic way. Without the help of a psychological perspective, this astounding variability may have gone unnoticed. However, to the anthropologist, it is too early to speak of a “requiem for the omniscient informent” because the ideal model “fits” with the rest of the culture-for example, the symbolic separation between the left and right parts of the body. Arithmetic computations can be performed by the older Yupno men using the traditional Yupno system and by children using school algorithms but not by those young men who are in between two cultures. {\textcopyright} 1994, Sage Publications.

@article{Brown2012,
abstract = {There is consensus that the modern human lineage appeared in Africa before 100,000 years ago. But there is debate as to when cultural and cognitive characteristics typical of modern humans first appeared, and the role that these had in the expansion of modern humans out of Africa. Scientists rely on symbolically specific proxies, such as artistic expression, to document the origins of complex cognition. Advanced technologies with elaborate chains of production are also proxies, as these often demand high-fidelity transmission and thus language. Some argue that advanced technologies in Africa appear and disappear and thus do not indicate complex cognition exclusive to early modern humans in Africa. The origins of composite tools and advanced projectile weapons figure prominently in modern human evolution research, and the latter have been argued to have been in the exclusive possession of modern humans. Here we describe a previously unrecognized advanced stone tool technology from Pinnacle Point Site 5-6 on the south coast of South Africa, originating approximately 71,000 years ago. This technology is dominated by the production of small bladelets (microliths) primarily from heat-treated stone. There is agreement that microlithic technology was used to create composite tool components as part of advanced projectile weapons. Microliths were common worldwide by the mid-Holocene epoch, but have a patchy pattern of first appearance that is rarely earlier than 40,000 years ago, and were thought to appear briefly between 65,000 and 60,000 years ago in South Africa and then disappear. Our research extends this record to ∼71,000 years, shows that microlithic technology originated early in South Africa, evolved over a vast time span (∼11,000 years), and was typically coupled to complex heat treatment that persisted for nearly 100,000 years. Advanced technologies in Africa were early and enduring; a small sample of excavated sites in Africa is the best explanation for any perceived 'flickering' pattern. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {Research over the past decade has significantly advanced our understanding of the prehispanic Maya codices, both in terms of their content (i.e., hieroglyphic texts, calendrical structure, and iconography) as well as the physical documents themselves (where and when they were painted, and by whom). Recent avenues of exploration include a new emphasis on linguistic and textual analyses; novel methodologies for interpreting calendrical structure; and comparisons with other manuscript traditions, in particular those from highland central Mexico. As a result of these studies, researchers have found that some codical almanacs functioned as real-time instruments to document important astronomical events; others were used to schedule rituals as part of the 52-year calendar that guided civic and religious life in Mesoamerica during the Late Postclassic period (circa A.D. 1250 to 1520). Evidence of connections with central Mexico, documented in terms of interchange among codical scribes, suggests the need for a more thorough exploration of Maya-highland Mexican interaction during this time period.},

Noyce served as Fairchild Semiconductor's first head of R&D and as its general manager for the six years of the company's most dramatic growth. His technical orientation, personal interest in new technologies, and hands-off management style helped establish a culture at the firm that welcomed innovations in research, process technology, manufacturing, and marketing. As Fairchild Semiconductor grew into a multidivisional mass producer, Noyce's entrepreneurial leadership proved inadequate. Communication breakdowns between divisions, coupled with a series of poor decisions by the parent company, further contributed to the decline of Fairchild Semiconductor.},

@article{Schmandt-Besserat1979,
abstract = {In the ancient Middle East (ninth-second millennia B. C.), reckoning was practiced with the help of clay tokens in geometric and odd shapes which stood for numbers and various commodities. This paper presents an assemblage of 661 tokens dating from the end of the fourth millennium B. C. (Uruk-Jemdet Nasr period) which are classified into 15 main types with some 200 subtypes. Charts illustrate the occurrence of each type in major sites of Iran, Iraq and Syria. The paper discusses the series of major innovations which characterize the evolution of the token system at the end of the fourth millennium B. C. and in particular: 1. An improvement in the manufacture of the tokens. 2. An increase in the repertory of shapes of tokens including the appearance of naturalistic types such as animal heads, vessels and utensils. 3. A proliferation of markings on the surface of the tokens: incised lines (55% of the tokens), punched markings (4%) and appliqu&#xe9; pellets or coils. 4. The appearance of perforations on 30% of the tokens, suggesting the stringing of tokens for special transactions. 5. The storage of tokens in archives by means of sealed envelopes (bullae) sometimes provided with exterior markings which correspond with the shape and number of tokens included inside. The various innovations in the archaic recording system around 3100 B. C. are viewed as a response to the pressure of economic developments such as the expansion of crafts production in workshops, the increase in local and long distance trade and the emergence of bureaucracy in the new city states. The first written tablets which appear about 3100 B. C. are presented as the ultimate result of the evolution of the token system; it is suggested that writing derives from the system of markings used on the bullae. A series of charts stresses the similarity between pictographs and tokens, which leads to the conclusion that the first signs of Sumerian writing represented numbers and commodities according to the shape of the tokens used in the archaic recording system.},

@book{Richardson2007,
abstract = {The idea of forecasting the weather by calculation was first dreamt of by Lewis Fry Richardson. The first edition of this book, published in 1922, set out a detailed algorithm for systematic numerical weather prediction. The method of computing atmospheric changes, which he mapped out in great detail in this book, is essentially the method used today. He was greatly ahead of his time because, before his ideas could bear fruit, advances in four critical areas were needed: better understanding of the dynamics of the atmosphere; stable computational algorithms to integrate the equations; regular observations of the free atmosphere; and powerful automatic computer equipment. Over the ensuing years, progress in numerical weather prediction has been dramatic. Weather prediction and climate modelling have now reached a high level of sophistication, and are witness to the influence of Richardson's ideas. This edition contains a new foreword by Peter Lynch that sets the original book in context.},

@article{10.2307/41157700,
abstract = {This essay examines the contradictions in the racial thought of the renowned Austrian anthropologist and ethnologist Felix von Luschan (1854-1924). In the 1880s, he began comparing the physical, mental, and linguistic characteristics of peoples worldwide, arguing that "race" generally was a meaningless construct. Luschan challenged racial theories that supported anti-Semitism and demolished racial hierarchies of "superior" and "inferior" peoples. Despite his anti-racist anthropology, at the First Universal Races Congress in 1911 Luschan simultaneously espoused racial tolerance and supported colonialism, eugenics, and German nationalism. The African-American historian, sociologist, and polemicist W.E.B. Du Bois first noted the inconsistencies in Luschan's arguments. Stranded in the United States in the early months of World War I, Luschan tried to refine his conclusions by recording the racial characteristics of hundreds of African-American subjects. Based on his American field work, Luschan wrote optimistically about the progress of American blacks since emancipation, yet, like white conservatives in America, he judged African Americans to be the crux of an unsolvable "race problem." Though committed theoretically to trans-Atlantic racial reform, gradually after 1900 Luschan's understanding of "race" became enshrouded by hereditarianism and Social Darwinism. Ironically, while his early dismissal of Aryan supremacy and anti-Semitic theories earned Luschan the condemnation of Nazis in the 1930s, his later endorsement of eugenics and Social Darwinism left Luschan undervalued and marginalized by modern students of racial thought.},

It has recently been argued that previous studies putatively illustrating infants' ability to add and subtract tapped into specialized object-tracking processes that apply only with small numbers. This argument contrasts with the original interpretation that successful performance was achieved via a numerical system for estimating and calculating magnitudes. Here, we report that when continuous variables (such as area and contour length) are controlled, 9-month-old infants successfully add and subtract over numbers of items that exceed object-tracking limits. These results support the theory that infants possess a magnitude-based estimation system for representing numerosities that also supports procedures for numerical computation.},

abstract = {Minck, interviewed at HP in late 1957 by Barney Oliver after finishing a dual EE/MBA Stanford degree, was 'bounced' from R&D consideration, and sent to Cort Van Rensselaer as a possible marketing candidate. It was propitious, launching a 37 year career for John, serving first as John Young's right hand man in marketing at the freewheeling microwave division-the source of so much of HP's leadership in products, revenues, and profits for years-and then as the department manager for the emergent light-emitting diodes that HP launched just prior to introduction of personal electronics equipment such as HP handheld calculators. Throughout, Minck maintained a strong professional involvement, with Standards committees and industry associations that furthered HP influence and stature. He served as a major advocate for HP in so many venues that it would be hard to overstate his impact on the evolution of this redoubtable little Palo Alto company as it grew from a few hundred employees to a few hundred thousand. What is most remarkable, though, about Minck is his willingness to tell the stories behind the scenes. John concluded, some thirty years after he started at HP, that its size was getting in its way, and its history was being forgotten. He set out to chronicle some of the more important elements, capturing much of the early lore about HP philosophy, especially from the sales and marketing perspective. But his most important chapter, he felt, was about 'the people.' In his own words, "Starting with Bill and Dave themselves, we will find a human side that cries out to be replicated in all our new people. I want all our new people to understand that they can break through the "safe" operating mode and use their creativity, challenge the bureaucratic processes, and keep the company loose and interesting and fun to work for." This revision of his longstanding HP chronicle is incisive with its sometimes biting, unflinching portrayal of some of the key players of yesteryear-words that others have spoken, but not written; stories long suspected, but never verified. What is it they say: "the pen is mightier than the sword" or for that matter, the exalted position. We are fortunate that a man with Minck's observational powers has chosen to memorialize this important era for us all-Chuck House 2 John Minck Biography John Minck retired in 1995, after a 37-year career with Hewlett-Packard Co. He held technical marketing assignments, mostly in microwave and communication product areas, and was RF/MW marketing communications manager for several decades, before retirement in 1995. In the early 1970's, Minck managed an HP venture product group which designed and introduced light-emitting diodes into the market, contributing LED numeric displays to HP's first HP-35 engineering pocket calculator. Since 1972, Minck has been active with NCSL International, a global trade association, with interest in metrology, quality and calibration issues. He was National President of NCSLI for 1977, and since 1979 has been editor of the organization's NCSLI Newsletter for 28 years. In 1987, Minck was honored with NCSLI's highest award, the William A. Wildhack Prize, in recognition of his contributions to the field of metrology. Minck was born in},

abstract = {This book is the most comprehensive empirical study to date of the social and technical aspects of milling during the ancient and medieval periods. Drawing on the latest archaeological evidence and historical studies, the book examines the chronological development and technical details of handmills, beast mills, watermills and windmills from the first millennium BCE to c. 1500. It discusses the many and varied uses to which mills were turned in the civilisations of Rome, China, Islam and Europe, and the many types of mill that existed. The book also includes comparative regional studies of the social and economic signifance of milling, and tackles several important historiographical issues, such as whether technological stagnation was a characteristic of late Antiquity, whether there was an "industrial revolution" in the European Middle Ages based on waterpower, and how contemporary studies in the social shaping of technology can shed light on the study of pre-modern technology.},

@incollection{PERL2002-33,
abstract = {{Perl in a Nutshell strives to be a perfect set of socket tools for the active Perl programmer. By and large, it succeeds, providing endless and well-thought-out lists and tables on the language's modules, flags, and extensions. The authors briefly address basic learner's questions--such as the difference between a hash and an array--but these concepts are not the purpose of the book. (Those new to Perl would be better off with others in the O'Reilly Perl series, such as Learning Perl, while programmers making the switch to Perl can pick up the nuances of the language with Programming Perl.) This book is pure Perl reference, briefly covering Perl/Tk (for GUI Perl programs on Unix and Windows 95/NT) and Perl for Win 32. The authors do start at the very beginning, and even in a self-described "desktop quick reference" find the time to comment on less urgent--but still interesting--Perl-related matters (like how to find online help amidst the "Perl culture"). The format of the book makes sections on topics such as Perl debugging easily understandable, illustrating how to make an interactive and timesaving environment. Of particular convenience is the outstanding section on the standard Perl modules. A four-page "quick look" allows you to easily scan through short definitions of all the modules and find the entry you're looking for. An index with full definitions for each module follows, showing you how to use each module and providing a more in-depth explanation (and often, examples). Perl in a Nutshell concludes--as you might expect--with an excellent and well-cross-referenced index. --Jennifer Buckendorff} {This complete guide to the Perl programming language ranges widely through the Perl programmer's universe, gathering together in a convenient form a wealth of information about Perl itself and its application to CGI scripts, XML processing, network programming, database interaction, and graphical user interfaces. The book is an ideal reference for experienced Perl programmers and beginners alike. With more than a million dedicated programmers, Perl is proving to be the best language for the latest trends in computing and business, including network programming and the ability to create and manage web sites. It's a language that every Unix system administrator and serious web developer needs to know. In the past few years, Perl has found its way into complex web applications of multinational banks, the U.S. Federal Reserve, and hundreds of large corporations. In this second edition, Perl in a Nutshell has been expanded to include coverage of Perl 5.8, with information on Unicode processing in Perl, new functions and modules that have been added to the core language, and up-to-date details on running Perl on the Win32 platform. The book also covers Perl modules for recent technologies such as XML and SOAP. Here are just some of the topics contained in this book: Basic Perl reference Quick reference to built-in functions and standard modules CGI.pm and mod_perl XML::* modules DBI, the database-independent API for Perl Sockets programming LWP, the library for Web programming in Perl Network programming with the Net modules Perl/Tk, the Tk extension to Perl for graphical interfaces Modules for interfacing with Win32 systems As part of the successful "in a Nutshell" book series from O'Reilly & Associates, Perl in a Nutshell is for readers who want a single reference for all their needs. "In a nutshell, Perl is designed to make the easy jobs easy, without making the hard jobs impossible." -- Larry Wall, creator of Perl}},

These initial doses were obviously too high, and it was then understood that the estimation of the white-skinned person's tolerance level to oral PUVA could not be based solely on the phenotype (hair and eye color).</p>},

To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved [274e] or disapproved. The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, “This invention, O king,” said Theuth, “will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.” But Thamus replied, “Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;"},

@article{murphy1995hyphens-marginal,
annote = {(private-note)"The Marginal Hyphen or Coupling Stroke" (299-305) - derived from the sublinear hyphen. Stage 1: sublinear hyphen. Stage 2: where a hyphenated word pair occurred at the end of a line, a sublinear hyphen would be placed at the end of the first line or the start of the second. See Paris A. of Plato. Vat. gr. 1591, copied in Italy 964-965. Some boat-shaped hyphens (8r, 15r), some horizontal (292r). In the 12th C, paired sublinear hyphens appear at the end of the first line *and* the start of the second. See 123v of Vat. gr. 1992, Gregory of Nazianzus, 1104. Stage 3: boat-shaped sublinear hyphens protrude into the margin. See New York Pierpont Morgan 652, 890, 294v. Stage 4: stages 2 & 3 suggested to scribes the possibility of using hyphens for non-compound words, where the page layout would otherwise cause confusion. Stage 5: true "coupling stroke"; any divided word warranted a hyphen. First example is Ambr. B 56 sup., copied in Campania 1022.

annote = {Paper is made from the papyrus, by splitting it with a needle into very thin leaves, due care being taken that they should be as broad as possible. That of the first quality is taken from the centre of the plant, and so in regular succession, according to the order of division. "Hieratica"1 was the name that was anciently given to it, from the circumstance that it was entirely reserved for the religious books. In later times, through a spirit of adulation, it received the name of "Augusta," just as that of second quality was called "Liviana," from his wife, Livia; the consequence of which was, that the name "hieratica" came to designate that of only third-rate quality. The paper of the next quality was called "amphitheatrica," from the locality2 of its manufacture. The skilful manufactory that was established by Fannius3 at Rome, was in the habit of receiving this last kind, and there, by a very careful process of insertion, it was rendered much finer; so much so, that from being a common sort, he made it a paper of first-rate quality, and gave his own4 name to it: while that which was not subjected to this additional process retained its original name of "amphitheatrica." Next to this is the Saitic paper, so called from the city of that name,5 where it is manufactured in very large quantities, though of cuttings of inferior6 quality. The T{\ae}niotic paper, so called from a place in the vicinity,7 is manufactured from the materials that lie nearer to the outside skin; it is sold, not according to its quality, but by weight only. As to the paper that is known as "emporetica,"8 it is quite useless for writing upon, and is only employed for wrapping up other paper, and as a covering for various articles of merchandize, whence its name, as being used by dealers. After this comes the bark of the papyrus, the outer skin of which bears a strong resemblance to the bulrush, and is solely used for making ropes, and then only for those which have to go into the water.9All these various kinds of paper are made upon a table, moistened with Nile water; a liquid which, when in a muddy state, has the peculiar qualities of glue.10 This table being first inclined,11 the leaves of papyrus are laid upon it lengthwise, as long, indeed, as the papyrus will admit of, the jagged edges being cut off at either end; after which a cross layer is placed over it, the same way, in fact, that hurdles are made. When this is done, the leaves are pressed close together, and then dried in the sun; after which they are united to one another, the best sheets being always taken first, and the inferior ones added afterwards. There are never more than twenty of these sheets to a roll.121 Or "holy" paper. The priests would not allow it to be sold, lest it might be used for profane writing; but after it was once written upon, it was easily procurable. The Romans were in the habit of purchasing it largely in the latter state, and then washing off the writing, and using it as paper of the finest quality. Hence it received the name of "Augustus," as representing in Latin its Greek name "hieraticus," or "sacred." In length of time it became the common impression, as here mentioned, that this name was given to it in honour of Augusus C{\ae}sar.2 Near the amphitheatre, probably, of Alexandria.
3 He alludes to Q. Remmius Fannius Pal{\ae}mon, a famous grammarian of Rome, though originally a slave. Being mantumitted, he opened a school at Rome, which was resorted to by great numbers of pupils, notwithstanding his notoriously bad character lie appears to have established, also, a manufactory for paper at Rome. Suetonius, in his treatise on Illustrious Grammarians, gives a long account of him. He is supposed to have been the preceptor of Quintilian.

10 F{\'{e}}e remarks, that this is by no means the fact. With M. Poiret, he questions the accuracy of Pliny's account of preparing the papyrus, and is of opinion that it refers more probably to the treatment of some other vegetable substance from which paper was made.

Communicating with clarity is the challenge imposed with text-based forms of dialogues, and this becomes more and more important as a greater number of our personal and professional exchanges are transacted via text-based methods of delivery. Use of email, text messaging (texting), instant messaging (IM), discussion forums, and social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter are increasingly routine and rapidly becoming the norm for many day-to-day interactions.This article proposes that a new set of typographic elements needs to be developed that extends our written vocabulary, complementing and improving the communication opportunities that technology – and its increasingly text-based forms of interactions – offers.

The influence of historical events, people, organizations, research, and trends was explored in depth. Studying the changes that calculators have brought to mathematics curriculum and how educators have reacted in the past will help to explain why math curriculum and school systems have adopted the attitudes and policies about calculators that they currently hold. This study found similar attitudes and reactions by parents and educators toward calculator usage in contrast to the opinions and mandates of organizations such as the NCTM, the College Board, and local school board administrations. Parents and educators were strikingly more hesitant and concerned regarding the effects of calculators than educational institutions. The results will be useful for future curriculum decisions in mathematics classrooms.},

abstract = {The time of arrival of people in Australia is an unresolved question. It is relevant to debates about when modern humans first dispersed out of Africa and when their descendants incorporated genetic material from Neanderthals, Denisovans and possibly other hominins. Humans have also been implicated in the extinction of Australia's megafauna. Here we report the results of new excavations conducted at Madjedbebe, a rock shelter in northern Australia. Artefacts in primary depositional context are concentrated in three dense bands, with the stratigraphic integrity of the deposit demonstrated by artefact refits and by optical dating and other analyses of the sediments. Human occupation began around 65,000 years ago, with a distinctive stone tool assemblage including grinding stones, ground ochres, reflective additives and ground-edge hatchet heads. This evidence sets a new minimum age for the arrival of humans in Australia, the dispersal of modern humans out of Africa, and the subsequent interactions of modern humans with Neanderthals and Denisovans.},

Effect sizes were derived by the method invented by Glass and tested for consistency and significance with inferential statistics provided by Hedges. At all grades but Grade 4, a use of calculators in concert with traditional mathematics instruction apparently improves the average student's basic skills with paper and pencil, both in working exercises and in problem solving. Sustained calculator use in Grade 4 appears to hinder the development of basic skills in average students. Across all grade and ability levels, students using calculators possess a better attitude toward mathematics and an especially better self-concept in mathematics than students not using calculators.},

@phdthesis{thanh2000,
abstract = {This thesis investigates the possibility to improve the quality of text composition. Two typographic extensions were examined: margin kerning and composing with font expansion.

Margin kerning is the adjustments of the characters at the margins of a typeset text. A simplified employment of margin kerning is hanging punctuation. Margin kerning is needed for optical alignment of the margins of a typeset text, because mechanical justification of the margins makes them look rather ragged. Some characters can make a line appear shorter to the human eye than others. Shifting such characters by an appropriate amount into the margins would greatly improve the appearance of a typeset text. Composing with font expansion is the method to use a wider or narrower variant of a font to make interword spacing more even. A font in a loose line can be substituted by a wider variant so the interword spaces are stretched by a smaller amount. Similarly, a font in a tight line can be replaced by a narrower variant to reduce the amount that the interword spaces are shrunk by. There is certainly a potential danger of font distortion when using such manipulations, thus they must be used with extreme care. The potentiality to adjust a line width by font expansion can be taken into consideration while a paragraph is being broken into lines, in order to choose better breakpoints. These typographic extensions were implemented in pdfTEX, a derivation of TEX. Heavy experiments have been done to examine the influence of the extensions on the quality of typesetting. The extensions turned out to noticeably improve the appearance of a typeset text. A number of `real-world' documents have been typeset using these typographic extensions, including this thesis.},

This article records the treatment of the find from the time of discovery in 1896 until the present day. The materials and methods used to preserve the manuscripts are presented in the light of our current knowledge, in order to have a better understanding of their condition and evaluate future conservation. Examination and analysis, primarily based on work carried out at the British Museum since the 1980s, is reported. For reference purposes, a detailed list is given containing descriptions, known conservation treatments and the condition of each manuscript.},

While we encounter these tiny shapes hundreds of times a day, we take for granted the long, fascinating history behind one of the most fundamental inventions - the alphabet." "David Sacks has embarked on an excursion into cultural history in Language Visible. Clearly explaining the letters as symbols of precise sounds of speech, the book begins with the earliest known alphabetic inscriptions (circa 1800 B.C.), recently discovered by archaeologists in Egypt, and traces the history of our alphabet through the ancient Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, and up through medieval Europe to the present day. But the heart of the book is the twenty-six fact-filled "biographies" of letters A through Z, each one identifying its letter's particular significance for modern readers, tracing its development from ancient forms, and discussing its noteworthy role in literature and other media. We learn, for example, why letter X may have a sinister and sexual aura, how B came to signify second best, why the word "mother" in many languages starts with an M, and what The Story of O is. The book also features clever illustrations for each letter, such as Winston Churchill's "V-for-Victory" World War II hand sign, the trademark "N" from the label of Newman's Own salad dressing, and images from rock music and other pop culture." "Combining facts both odd and essential, Language Visible is cultural history at its most accessible and enjoyable."--BOOK JACKET.},

From the reviews: "This book ranks with the most erudite Asian publications, and is the most informative and most broadly informed on its topic in any language." N. Sivin, China Quarterly "⋯ crammed with insights, cautionary tales and a great deal of information about current research ⋯ will surely become a standard reference for students, teachers, and researchers alike", J. N. Crossley, Annals of Science "⋯ a truly scholarly and balanced exposition ⋯ a book that the reviewer believes belongs in the library of every university or college, as well as in that of every individual seriously interested in the history of Chinese mathematics", B. L. McAllister, ZBfM "Martzloff History demonstrates clearly that while the Chinese were adept in applying their mathematics to a host of practical problems, including astronomy and engineering as well as commercial transactions, they also paid attention to algorithmic techniques, methods of calculation, geometric constructions, and even certain purely logical problems. But above all, what sets this book apart from the usual histories of mathemathics (in any language, Chinese or Western, of any period or country) is its emphasis first on context, then on content, in describing the long history of Chinese mathematics ⋯. It is primarily the question of context that Martzloff approaches directly. Perhaps the greatest contribution his book makes is the chance it offers to consider issues of cultural context as significant, determining factors in the history of mathematics. Thus, Martzloff tries to get inside the Chinese mind, to explain how and why mathematics developed as it did in China, and often in ways strikingly different from its Western counterparts. Although he does not always account for these differences, he succeeds admirably in describing them, which results in a refreshingly rich sense of its evolution as well." Joseph W.

@article{Orton2009,
abstract = {This book sets out to explain the development of modern electronic systems and devices from the viewpoint of the semiconductor materials (germanium, silicon, gallium arsenide and many others) which made them possible. It covers the scientific understanding of these materials and its intimate relationship with their technology and many applications. It began with Michael Faraday, took off in a big way with the invention of the transistor at Bell Labs in 1947 and is still burgeoning today. It is a story to match any artistic or engineering achievement of man and this is the first time it has been presented in a style suited to the non-specialist. It is written in a lively, non-mathematical style which brings out the excitement of discovery and the fascinating interplay between the demands of system pull and technological push. It also looks at the nature of some of the personal interactions which helped to shape the modern technological world. An introductory chapter illustrates just how dependent we are on modern electronic systems and explains the significance of semiconductors in their development. It also provides, in as painless a way as possible, a necessary understanding of semiconductor properties in relation to these applications. The second chapter takes up the historical account and ends with some important results emerging from the Second World War - including its effect on the organisation of scientific research. Chapter three describes the world-shaking discovery of the transistor and some of the early struggles to make it commercially viable, including the marketing of the first transistor radio. In chapter four we meet the integrated circuit which gave shape to much of our modern life in the form of the personal computer (and which gave rise to a famously long-running patent war!). Later chapters cover the application of compound semiconductors to light-emitting devices, such as LEDs and lasers, and light detecting devices such as photocells. We learn how these developments led to the invention of the CD player and DVD recorder, how other materials were applied to the development of sophisticated night vision equipment, fibre optical communications systems, solar photovoltaic panels and flat panel displays. Similarly, microwave techniques essential to our modern day love of mobile phoning are seen to depend on clever materials scientists who, not for the first time, "invented" new semiconductors with just the right properties. Altogether, it is an amazing story and one which deserves to be more widely known. Read this book and you will be rewarded with a much deeper understanding and appreciation of the technological revolution which shapes so many aspects of our lives. - A historical account of the development of semiconductor physics, devices and applications from the nineteenth century to the present day - Coverage of the importance of material quality and it's relation to the physics of the devices - Presented in a strictly non-mathematical and anecedotal way, to appeal to a wide audience - Provides the broad sweep of science history.

@article{Ratcliff2007,
abstract = {[This paper presents the story of two calculating machines invented by Sir Samuel Morland (1625-95) in the 1660s. These instruments are the earliest known mechanical calculators made in England. Their designs are unusual and very much of their time. They appealed to some, especially at court, and were dismissed by others, such as Robert Hooke. The first part of the paper introduces Morland and the courtier-inventor's world, in which a reputation as a 'machinist' or an engineer could accompany high social status. It considers why a former diplomat and postal spy would turn to invention in general and to mechanical calculators in particular as a career move in the Restoration court. The second part addresses the instruments - attention to their design reveals Morland's inspiration. The paper concludes with an examination of the market for the calculators in London, Paris and Florence. While it is notable that the calculators circulated both in court and in the commercial sphere, even more interesting is the contrast between their receptions in these two spheres. The story of these machines and their maker helps flesh out the poorly understood world of the courtier-inventor in early modern England.]},

@article{Rosenband2004Comparing,
abstract = {In 1796, both France and England banned combinations among paperworkers. Most notably, these measures read as if they issued from a single pen. The twin efforts outlawed the coalitions and covenants that enabled the journeymen to organize strikes and walkouts, influence wages or output quotas, restrain the manufacturers' latitude in hiring, and burden, even fine, unco-operative masters. By linking the lived experience of the labour process and the law, this article explores the real grit of comparative history. In doing so, it reveals the risk of emphasizing national industrial culture in the age of manufactures and nascent mechanization. It also suggests the shortcomings of Foucauldian analysis and metaphors when they are brought to the ground, that is, the actual shopfloor struggles and everyday relations of papermaking. Moreover, this article contends that authorities in Paris and London brewed a subtle blend of intervention and retreat in the governance of the trade. In the end, however, the effective regulation of papermaking, from below, survived the sister combination acts. Mechanization tipped the balance in favour of the manufacturers, but the workers' tactics and habits of resistance persisted into the new era.},

Over its 10-year history, the Math Tables Project completed 28 published volumes of tables and calculations for dozens of scientific and war projects. During World War II, it acted as a general computing contractor for the Office for Scientific Research and Development and prepared LORAN Navigation Tables for the Navy. After the war, it was absorbed by the National Bureau of Standards.

He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians.

@article{Holmes2018,
abstract = {She was the first woman in the United States to become a professional astronomer, and a dauntless champion of science education for women. Maria Mitchell, whose bicentenary is celebrated this August, was a scientific revolutionary. That is encapsulated in her prophetic speech, ‘The Need for Women in Science', delivered in 1876 to the Fourth Congress of the Association for the Advancement of Women, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It posed a historic challenge. Mitchell declared that the laws of nature are discovered not through “the hurry and worry of daily toil; they are diligently sought ... And until able women have given their lives to investigation, it is idle to discuss the question of their capacity for original work.” Or, as she put it in her journals: “better to be peering in the spectrograph than on the pattern of a dress”. Mitchell's agile mind, pedagogic fire and salty opinions bring extraordinary animation to her varied collection of scientific papers, articles, notebooks and journals. Some were first published by her sister Phebe Mitchell Kendall, in the 1896 Maria Mitchell: Life, Letters, and Journals, just seven years after her death. More recent volumes include Henry Albers's edited Maria Mitchell: A Life in Journals and Letters (2001) and Ren{\'{e}}e Bergland's Maria Mitchell and the Sexing of Science (2008). Independent, combative and original, Mitchell became a major public figure by the end of her life. She “stands out clear and conspicuous”, noted her Scientific American obituary in July 1889, “like an evening star in the heavens she loved so well to study”. She was born in 1818, into a large Quaker family on the island whaling station of Nantucket, off the Massachusetts coast. It was a place of horizon-gazers, seafarers and lighthouse keepers, where men were often away and Quakerism honoured gender equality. From early childhood she was encouraged to pursue science by her beloved father, a director of the local bank and an amateur astronomer with contacts at Harvard University's observatory in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Together they scanned the skies using a Dollond telescope from the rooftop ‘walk' of their house. Early on, Mitchell revealed extraordinary observational powers, natural mathematical gifts and unusual sensitivity to stellar movements and colours. At 17, she opened her own school; a year later, she was appointed supervisor of the local library, the Nantucket Atheneum. Her constant companion was a notebook, carried in a capacious pocket. Her speech was direct, her ideas increasingly radical. “We cannot accept anything as granted,” she wrote in her journal, “beyond the first mathematical formulae. Question everything else.” ￼ ￼ Maria Mitchell argued for women's education.Credit: Bettman/Getty},

abstract = {About fifty years ago, Elea 9003, the first Italian mainframe fully transistorized, was built in the Olivetti Electronic Research Laboratory. The mainframe was realized with a drain of international expertise and training on-the-job of scientific staff. The head of the Laboratory, Mario Tchou, had a valuable experience in electronics in the U.S. and his collaborators, at first mainly Italian, were chosen for previous experience in pulse modulation methods. Elea 9003 was built with germanium diodes and transistors. They successfully sold the mainframe on the national market, but Olivetti electronic enterprise did not last. After the unexpected deaths of Adriano Olivetti (1960) and Mario Tchou (1961) there were inner contrasts in the management. Moreover, the national market was very limited and the Italian government did not help in any way the company. Therefore, in 1964 due to financial problems and shortsighted business strategies, Olivetti dismissed its main electronic assets and sold the Electronic Department to General Electric. However, the seeds of the work done by Olivetti Laboratory sprouted later on in computer science thanks to Programma 101, the first desktop computer.},

abstract = {Compound adhesives made from red ochre mixed with plant gum were used in the Middle Stone Age (MSA), South Africa. Replications reported here suggest that early artisans did not merely color their glues red; they deliberately effected physical transformations involving chemical changes from acidic to less acidic pH, dehydration of the adhesive near wood fires, and changes to mechanical workability and electrostatic forces. Some of the steps required for making compound adhesive seem impossible without multitasking and abstract thought. This ability suggests overlap between the cognitive abilities of modern people and people in the MSA. Our multidisciplinary analysis provides a new way to recognize complex cognition in the MSA without necessarily invoking the concept of symbolism.},

abstract = {From the reviews: The book is, in spite of the author's more modest claims, an introductory survey of main developments in those disciplines which were particularly important in Medieval Islamic mathematics...No knowledge of mathematics (or of the history of mathematics) beyond normal high-school level is presupposed, and everything required beyond that (be it Apollonian theory of conics or the definitions of celestial circles) is explained carefully and clearly. Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general. The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general. - Jens H{\o}yrup, Mathematical Reviews ...as a textbook, this work is highly commendable...It is definitely the product of a skillful mathematician who has collected over the years a reasonably large number of interesting problems from medieval Arabic mathematics. None of them is pursued to exhaustion, but all of them arranged in such a way, together with accompanying exercises, so that they would engage an active mind and introduce a subject, which I am sure the author agrees with me is, at this stage, very difficult to introduce. - G.Saliba, Zentralblatt},

A measure of the usefulness of the abacus is seen by the fact that it survived the advent of algorism by some six centuries but its major significance for western culture lies in its perfect and seminal representation of the decimal system.]},

@article{Friberg2019,
abstract = {The Mesopotamian system of sexagesimal counting numbers was based on the progressive series of units 1, 10, 1{\textperiodcentered}60, 10{\textperiodcentered}60, {\ldots}. It may have been in use already before the invention of writing, with the mentioned units represented by various kinds of small clay tokens. After the invention of proto-cuneiform writing, c. 3300 BC, it continued to be used, with the successive units of the system represented by distinctive impressed cup- and disk-shaped number signs. Other kinds of “metrological” number systems in the proto-cuneiform script, with similar number signs, were used to denote area numbers, capacity numbers, etc. In a handful of known mathematical cuneiform texts from the latter half of the third millennium BC, the ancient systems of sexagesimal counting numbers and area numbers were still in use, alongside new kinds of systems of capacity numbers and weight numbers. Large area numbers, capacity numbers, and weight numbers were counted sexagesimally, while each metrological number system had its own kind of fractional units. In the system of counting numbers itself, fractions could be expressed as sixtieths, sixtieths of sixtieths, and so on, but also in terms of small units borrowed from the system of weight numbers. Among them were the “basic fractions” which we would understand as 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3. In a very early series of metro-mathematical division exercises and an equally early metro-mathematical table of squares (Early Dynastic III, c. 2400 BC), “quasi-integers” of the form “integer plus basic fraction” play a prominent role. Quasi-integers play an essential role also in a recently found atypical cuneiform table of reciprocals. The invention of sexagesimal numbers in place-value notation, in the Neo-Sumerian period c. 2000 BC, was based on a series of innovations. The range of the system of sexagesimal counting numbers was extended indefinitely both upward and downward, and the use of quasi-integers was abolished. Sexagesimal place-value numbers were used for all kinds of calculations in Old Babylonian mathematical cuneiform texts, c. 1700 BC, while traditional metrological numbers were retained in both questions and answers of the exercises. Examples of impressive computations of reciprocals of many-place regular sexagesimal place-value numbers, with no practical applications whatsoever, are known from the Old Babylonian period. In the Late Babylonian period (the latter half of the first millennium BC), such computations were still popular, performed by the same persons who constructed the many-place sexagesimal tables that make up the corpus of Late Babylonian mathematical astronomy.},

@article{Agrillo2012Guppies,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Humans and non-human animals share an approximate non-verbal system for representing and comparing numerosities that has no upper limit and for which accuracy is dependent on the numerical ratio. Current evidence indicates that the mechanism for keeping track of individual objects can also be used for numerical purposes; if so, its accuracy will be independent of numerical ratio, but its capacity is limited to the number of items that can be tracked, about four. There is, however, growing controversy as to whether two separate number systems are present in other vertebrate species. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we compared the ability of undergraduate students and guppies to discriminate the same numerical ratios, both within and beyond the small number range. In both students and fish the performance was ratio-independent for the numbers 1-4, while it steadily increased with numerical distance when larger numbers were presented. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that two distinct systems underlie quantity discrimination in both humans and fish, implying that the building blocks of uniquely human mathematical abilities may be evolutionarily ancient, dating back to before the divergence of bony fish and tetrapod lineages.},

Brilliant, voluble, cranky, a terrible gossip, and a genius of political manipulation, Cicero was Rome's most revered politician, one of the greatest statesmen of all time. Accessible to us through unguarded letters written to his best friend, Atticus, Cicero emerges as a witty and resourceful political manipulator, the most eloquent witness to the last days of Republican Rome.}},

The Phoenicians who came with Cadmus, and of whom the Gephyreans were a part, introduced during their residence in Greece the knowledge of various articles of science, and among other things letters, with which, as I conceive, the Greeks were before unacquainted. These were at first such as the Phoenicians themselves indiscriminately use; in process of time, however, they were changed both in sound and form. At that time the Greeks most contiguous to this people were the Ionians, who learned these letters of the Phoenicians, and, with some trifling variations, received them into common use. As the Phoenicians first made them known in Greece, they called them, as justice required, Phoenician letters. By a very ancient custom, the Ionians call their books diphterce or skins, because at a time when the plant of the biblos was scarce, they used instead of it the skins of goats and sheep. Many of the Barbarians have used these skins for this purpose within my recollection.},

He resigned his commission in 1864 to become an agent in the pension department of the Sanitary Commission, and later, chief clerk of the U.S. Pension Office. Seaton served as a division chief in the 1870 census and was superintendent of the New York state census of 1875. In 1879, he was appointed chief clerk of the tenth census under Francis Amasa Walker. When Walker resigned in 1881 to accept the presidency of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Seaton succeeded him as superintendent of the census, serving until the temporary Census Office closed. He died in Vermont in March 1885. By 1870, the census had become so extensive that it could no longer be processed by inaccurate and expensive hand tabulations. In a bid to solve this problem, Seaton invented a machine to tally census results. It was first used by the office in 1872 for the 1870 census and then again in 1880 before being replaced by Herman Hollerith&#039;s electronic tabulation machine in 1890. Seaton also invented a matrix printing apparatus for census work.},

Effect sizes were generated through Glassian techniques of meta-analysis, and Hedges and Olkin's (1985) inferential statistical methods were used to test the significance of effect size data. Results revealed that students' operational skills and problem-solving skills improved when calculators were an integral part of testing and instruction. The results for both skill types were mixed when calculators were not part of assessment, but in all cases, calculator use did not hinder the development of mathematical skills. Students using calculators had better attitudes toward mathematics than their noncalculator counterparts. Further research is needed in the retention of mathematics skills after instruction and transfer of skills to other mathematics-related subjects.},

annote = {The common paper paste is made of the finest flour of wheat mixed with boiling water, and some small drops of vinegar sprinkled in it: for the ordinary workman's paste, or gum, if employed for this purpose, will render the paper brittle. Those, however, who take the greatest pains, boil the crumb of leavened bread, and then strain off the water: by the adoption of this method the paper has the fewest seams caused by the paste that lies between, and is softer than the nap of linen even. All kinds of paste that are used for this purpose, ought not to be older or newer than one day. The paper is then thinned out with a mallet, after which a new layer of paste is placed upon it; then the creases which have formed are again pressed out, and it then undergoes the same process with the mallet as before. It is thus that we have memorials preserved in the ancient handwriting of Tiberius and Caius Gracchus, which I have seen in the possession of Pomponius Secundus,1 the poet, a very illustrious citizen, almost two hundred years since those characters were penned. As for the handwriting of Cicero, Augustus, and Virgil, we frequently see them at the present day.1 See B. vii. c. 18, and B. xiv. c. 6.

@article{GRAFTON1994,
abstract = {Footnotes seem to rank among the most colorless and uninteresting features of historical practice. In fact, however, footnoting practices have varied widely, over time and across space, between individuals and among national disciplinary communities. Little clarity has prevailed in the discussion of the purpose footnotes serve; even less attention has been devoted to the development they have undergone. This essay sketches the history of the footnote in the Western historical tradition. Drawing on classic work by A. D. Momigliano, H. Butterfield, and others, it shows that critical research into and argument about sources have long formed part of the historical tradition. Classical political historians could not insert much explicit reflection about the use of sources into their work without violating the rhetorical rules they accepted. But their histories, as the case of de Thou shows, often rested on careful critical work. And the many historians who did not provide instructive narratives of war and high politics, but rather, accounts of local history or religious institutions, discussed their sources, and sometimes quoted them extensively. These varied traditions were only integrated, however, by the invention of the footnote in its modern form, which made it possible to combine a high literary narrative with erudite investigations. The footnote in its modern form seems to have been devised in the seventeenth century, as part of an effort to counter skepticism about the possiblity of attaining knowledge about the past. It was used to great intellectual and literary effect in the eighteenth century, when individuals as different as Gibbon and Moser made the foundations of their texts into elaborate mosaics of erudite research and ironic reflection. Ranke did not invent, but dramatized, the historical foot-note. He made the research that produced it as vital to the historian's culture and as central to the historian's achievement as the high style that had distinguished pragmatic exemplar history of the traditional kind. The historical footnote emerges not as a simple trademark guaranteeing quality nor as a uniform piece of scholarly technology, but rather as the product of long collective struggles and individual efforts to devise a visibly critical form of historical writing.},

After repeated failures to drive the crow from the platform by scolding, approaching and diving at it, the jay flew into a bush where it worked vigorously to break off a stick. Having broken off the twig, the jay, with stick in bill, approached the crow and thrust the pointed stick at it. The crow lunged at the jay which then dropped the stick. The crow picked up the stick and flew after the jay. This appears to be the first case of a bird holding an object and using it in a weapon-like way during an aggressive action against another bird.},

@book{SchmandtBesserat1992,
abstract = {Before Writing gives a new perspective on the evolution of communication. It points out that when writing began in Mesopotamia it was not, as previously thought, a sudden and spontaneous invention. Instead, it was the outgrowth of many thousands of years' worth of experience at manipulating symbols. Denise Schmandt-Besserat presents a system of counters (tokens) that appeared in the Near East following the invention of agriculture (about 8000 B.C.) as the immediate precursor of Sumerian writing. Tokens were small objects modeled in clay in various geometric forms used for counting and accounting for goods. They remained in use during 5,000 years with little change, except at the rise of cities, when the types multiplied. The tokens represented a breakthrough in communication. They constituted the first code, the first system of signs for communication. They made it possible to deal concurrently with multiple kinds of data, thus allowing the processing of a volume and complexity of information never reached previously. Tokens functioned as an extension of the human brain to collect, manipulate, store, and retrieve data. In turn, processing an increasing volume of data brought people to think in greater abstraction. Before Writing discusses how the tokens reflect an archaic way of "concrete counting" that paved the way to abstract counting. The evolution of the token system was also tied to the development of political power, since accounting was key to the control of real goods. Before Writing documents how numeracy was the privilege of an elite and shows how the more complex the token system became the more power it wielded. Written in an engaging and lively style, Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform has significance far beyond a single field. It will be of interest to scholars and general readers interested in the origin of civilization, communication, and mathematics. A companion volume, Before Writing, Volume II: A Catalog of Near Eastern Tokens, is also available and contains the primary data on which Schmandt-Besserat bases her theories.},

This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians.

"Berlin draws upon interviews with dozens of key players in modern American business - including Andy Grove, Steve Jobs, Gordon Moore, and Warren Buffett; their recollections of Noyce give readers a privileged, first-hand look inside the dynamic world of high-tech entrepreneurship." --R�sum� de l'�diteur.},

annote = {(private-note)- NSW library logo: Hi Vince, Thanks for getting in touch so quickly! I don't know if you had a chance to read the interrobang articles already up at Shady Characters, but most of what I've written so far has been about the origins and early life of the interrobang. Given that it failed to catch on in the mainstream, I'm interested in the way that it seems to have become a sort of touchstone for those in the know about unusual punctuation. In the case of the NSW State Library logo, why did you choose the interrobang instead of creating an entirely new logo - The library was about to celebrate its 100th birthday. And wanted to mark it with a new identity and a repositioning across all it's communications and signage. We started by interviewing various stake holders and spent time going deep into the project. This informed our insight and helped us create the strategy based around 'surprising'. Not everything is on google and the physical act of the search is likely to uncover surprises. There is a massive wealth of content from Sydney's and Australia's history in the huge archives of this library. We tried many logos and differently Ways of expressing this. Then I remembered the interrobang. What it represented was perfect for the library. You go there looking for answers and it's often a eureka moment when you discover the answer or an inspiration. did you expect people to recognise the symbol? Not really as its not a familiar symbol but it's pretty straight forward for anyone to understand it. Does the interrobang as a concept (as opposed to its visual appearance) have a particular relevance to the library? In terms of the design, did you take it from an existing font, or did you create a new symbol? Did you use any existing designs as a guide? We found a font called chronicle which was similar to typeface engraved on the building 100 years ago. I tweaked the logo until I was happy with the space and longevity of the mark. I realise these might all be a little vague and disjointed, but I'm just excited to have come across a use of the interrobang in real life, so to speak! I hope this helps.},

Other than relatively brief summaries no serious account has ever been produced. This extended consideration will bring to the centre of research on the Hellinistic period this long sequence of wars. Arguably they were the basic causes of the failure of both kingdoms in the face of Roman aggression and interference.},

@techreport{Aalto2009,
abstract = {The ad-hoc meeting was chaired by Peter Constable. The ad-hoc discussed several open issues from national body comments on PDAM8 related to Emoji, plus additional expert or national-body contributions on Emoji received by WG2 (N3711, N3713). Through these deliberations, the ad-hoc was able to arrive at consensus on many issues that should open the way for WG2 to resolve ballot comments on PDAM8. The following describes the consensus decisions and recommendations of the Emoji ad-hoc committee: 1. In reference to Irish comment T8 on PDAM8, it is recommended that the following two additional characters be added in FPDAM8: 1F470 TWO MEN HOLDING HANDS 1F49F TWO WOMEN HOLDING HANDS Rationale: These complement a related symbol already included in PDAM8, 1F46B COUPLE. 2. In reference to Irish comment T8 on PDAM8, Ireland requested the addition of a new character CAMERA WITH FLASH. The Ad-hoc recommends that this not be added at this time, but invites Ireland submit a proposal with rationale for WG2 to consider in the future. 3. In reference to Irish comment T8 and UK comment T1 on PDAM8, it is recommended that the following additional character be added in FPDAM8: 1F4B7 BANKNOTE WITH POUND SIGN Rationale: This character was originally proposed in N3607; it complements three other similar characters already in PDAM8 which contain currency symbols for major world currencies. 4. In reference to Irish comment T11 on PDAM8, it is recommended that the following additional character be added in FPDAM8: 1F519 ANTICLOCKWISE DOWNWARDS AND UPWARDS OPEN CIRCLE ARROWS Rationale: This complements 1F515 CLOCKWISE UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS OPEN CIRCLE ARROWS which is already in PDAM8. Both characters are used in user interfaces with a common semantic (reload content); some attested products use one while other attested products use the other. 5. In reference to Irish comment T11 on PDAM8, it is recommended that the following twelve additional characters be added in FPDAM8: 1F55C CLOCK FACE ONE-THIRTY 1F55D CLOCK FACE TWO-THIRTY},

It had been Harry's plan to donate his personal collection to the University once it provided a suitable alternative to the outdated and inadequate library then located in Gore Hall. Mrs. Widener fulfilled her son's dream by building a facility of monumental proportions, with over 50 miles of shelves and the capacity to hold over three million volumes.
The library opened in 1915, but Harvard's collections continued to grow at an astounding rate and by the late 1930s, Widener's shelves were filled to capacity. Space was at a premium for staff and patrons as well as books, which lead the library administration to begin a lengthy decentralization process. Over time Harvard built several new libraries to house the increasingly specialized collections. By redistributing books to new libraries, space opened up in Widener, but it was gradually given over to the growing staff hired to attend to the collections.
In addition to the physical challenges associated with housing and maintaining an ever growing collection, the 20th-century also saw technological advancements that affected Widener from electrical wiring to a computerized card catalog to sophisticated research workstations.
Widener Library ushered in the new millennium in the midst of its greatest change since opening in 1915. From 1999 to 2004, the building underwent an extensive renovation to ensure the long-term preservation and security of collections and to increase user space. Renovations included an upgrade of the heating, ventilation, air conditioning, humidity control, electrical, lighting, fire suppression, and security systems. In addition, two new reading rooms and staff workspace were created in the building's two interior light courts, and space previously designated for staff was reallocated for patron use.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTIn considering the appropriate use of the terms “science” and “scientific instrument,” tracing the history of “mathematical instruments” in the early modern period is offered as an illuminating alternative to the historian's natural instinct to follow the guiding lights of originality and innovation, even if the trail transgresses contemporary boundaries. The mathematical instrument was a well-defined category, shared across the academic, artisanal, and commercial aspects of instrumentation, and its narrative from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century was largely independent from other classes of device, in a period when a “scientific” instrument was unheard of.},

abstract = {Humans' ability to count by verbally labeling discrete quantities is unique in animal cognition. The evolutionary origins of counting algorithms are not understood. We report that nonhuman primates exhibit a cognitive ability that is algorithmically and logically similar to human counting. Monkeys were given the task of choosing between two food caches. First, they saw one cache baited with some number of food items, one item at a time. Then, a second cache was baited with food items, one at a time. At the point when the second set was approximately equal to the first set, the monkeys spontaneously moved to choose the second set even before that cache was completely baited. Using a novel Bayesian analysis, we show that the monkeys used an approximate counting algorithm for comparing quantities in sequence that is incremental, iterative, and condition controlled. This proto-counting algorithm is structurally similar to formal counting in humans and thus may have been an important evolutionary precursor to human counting.},

abstract = {In the Eurasian Upper Paleolithic after about 35,000 years ago, abstract or depictional images provide evidence for cognitive abilities considered integral to modern human behavior. Here we report on two abstract representations engraved on pieces of red ochre recovered from the Middle Stone Age layers at Blombos Cave in South Africa. A mean date of 77,000 years was obtained for the layers containing the engraved ochres by thermoluminescence dating of burnt lithics, and the stratigraphic integrity was confirmed by an optically stimulated luminescence age of 70,000 years on an overlying dune. These engravings support the emergence of modern human behavior in Africa at least 35,000 years before the start of the Upper Paleolithic.},

abstract = {A SMALL electronic digital computing machine has been operating successfully for some weeks in the Royal Society Computing Machine Laboratory, which is at present housed in the Electrical Engineering Department of the University of Manchester. The machine is purely experimental, and is on too small a scale to be of mathematical value. It was built primarily to test the soundness of the storage principle employed and to permit experience to be gained with this type of machine before embarking on the design of a full-size machine. However, apart from its small size, the machine is, in principle, 'universal' in the sense that it can be used to solve any problem that can be reduced to a programme of elementary instructions ; the programme can be changed without any mechanical or electro-mechanical circuit changes. The modern computer was born on 21 June 1948, when the University of Manchester's Small-Scale Experimental Machine, nicknamed the 'Baby', successfully executed its first program. Designed and built by F. C. Williams and Tom Kilburn [Obituary of Tom Kilburn: Nature 409, 996 (2001)], the Baby kept only 1,024 bits in its main store, but it was the first computer to store a changeable user program in electronic memory and process it at electronic speed.},

abstract = {Herzstark, an Austrian inventor and manufacturer of calculators, describes the development of the Austrian Calculating Machine Manufacturing Company (Rechenmaschinefabrik der Austria Erstanden Compagnie) and his subsequent work in the industry. The company, founded in Vienna by his father, Samuel Herzstark, in 1905, introduced the first electrically-driven calculator based on improved designs of the Thomas Arithmometer. Herzstark describes the disruption of the industry during World War I, his involvement with the company after the war, competition with American companies, and his first invention, a mechanical memory for holding subtotals, which appeared in 1928. Herzstark managed the company in 1930 and began work on his own design for a hand-held calculator. With the Anschluss of 1938, the company was again converted to war production, and produced custom gauges for German tanks. Herzstark, a Jew, was able to avoid arrest until 1943, when he was sent to Buchenwald concentration camp and worked as a technician. He recounts his arrest and internment, and how he completed the design of the CURTA hand-held calculator, a prototype of which was produced in Weimar, Germany, by Rheinmetallwerke at the end of the war. The Prince of Liechtenstein bought the design and the calculator was initially manufactured by the CURTA division of Contina AG of Liechtenstein. It was produced until 1972, when the electronic calculator forced it from the market.},

abstract = {This work is an introduction to the origins and history of the Protestant Reformation. An overview of the Reformation, it blends social, political, religious and theological dimensions, drawing on the latest and best scholarship. It includes the history of the Reformation in Scandinavia and Eastern Europe, areas that are rarely covered in any detail. The Reformation is placed in the context of the entire history of Christianity to draw out its origins, impetus, and legacy.-- Provided by publisher. In 1517, the actions of a simple monk ushered in a period of unparalleled religious and political upheaval. This work provides a comprehensive introduction to this extraordinary period, showing how and why the Protestant Reformation arose and unfolded. In this account, the author blends social history, religious and theological ideas with economic and political factors. The description is well-rounded, drawing not just on the actions of the main characters, but also the experiences and ideas of ordinary people, the quest for social justice, and the conflicting approaches to Christian unity. The events of the Reformation are placed in the context of Christian history to offer a fuller understanding of the period. The result is a narrative that shows the reader exactly what was at stake, and why, as the events unfurled. Based on the best of current research, this book offers readers an overview of one of the most critical periods in Western history. -- Provided by publisher.},

@article{Roebroeks2011Fire,
abstract = {The timing of the human control of fire is a hotly debated issue, with claims for regular fire use by early hominins in Africa at ∼ 1.6 million y ago. These claims are not uncontested, but most archaeologists would agree that the colonization of areas outside Africa, especially of regions such as Europe where temperatures at time dropped below freezing, was indeed tied to the use of fire. Our review of the European evidence suggests that early hominins moved into northern latitudes without the habitual use of fire. It was only much later, from ∼ 300,000 to 400,000 y ago onward, that fire became a significant part of the hominin technological repertoire. It is also from the second half of the Middle Pleistocene onward that we can observe spectacular cases of Neandertal pyrotechnological knowledge in the production of hafting materials. The increase in the number of sites with good evidence of fire throughout the Late Pleistocene shows that European Neandertals had fire management not unlike that documented for Upper Paleolithic groups.},

abstract = {We often take punctuation for granted, but its evolution has been largely responsible for our ability to communicate meaning and convey emphasis with the written word. Believing that the best way to understand usage is to study it historically, Parkes focuses on how marks have actually been used. He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians.

Multiple lines of evidence indicate that $\sim$500,000-year-old stone points from the archaeological site of Kathu Pan 1 (KP1), South Africa, functioned as spear tips. KP1 points exhibit fracture types diagnostic of impact. Modification near the base of some points is consistent with hafting. Experimental and metric data indicate that the points could function well as spear tips. Shape analysis demonstrates that the smaller retouched points are as symmetrical as larger retouched points, which fits expectations for spear tips. The distribution of edge damage is similar to that in an experimental sample of spear tips and is inconsistent with expectations for cutting or scraping tools. Thus, early humans were manufacturing hafted multicomponent tools $\sim$200,000 years earlier than previously thought.},

The designs on the front and back covers are geometrical not only for showing the influence of compass and straight-edge. They are geometrical in conception as well, having proportions among their major dimensions that are all based on the 'two true measures of geometry,' the golden section ratio and the square root of two. This essay analyzes the forms of the designs and provides line-drawings to show how they could have been created. /// Der Originaleinband des mit den Reliquien des Hl. Cuthbert aufbewahrten Johannesevangeliars (7.Jh.), weist mit seinen Verflechtungsornamenten und geometrischen Mustern in beispielhafter Art alle charakteristischen Kompositionsmerkmale der fr{\"{u}}hen englischen Kunst auf. F{\"{u}}r die Kenntnis geometrischer Prinzipien spricht nicht nur das Wesen der sichtlich unter Verwendung von Zirkel und Lineal entstandenen Ornamente, sondern vor allem ihre Anordnung nach den Gesetzen des Goldenen Schnittes und der Quadratwurzel aus zwei. Die vorliegende Arbeit unternimmt eine Analyse der Muster und versucht an Hand von Zeichnungen, ihren Entstehungsprozess zu rekonstruieren.},

abstract = {Babylonian and Egyptian writing systems dominated the Near East during the third and second millennia B.C., but during the latter many other scripts arose. Among them was the infant alphabet whose history can be reconstructed in outline with the aid of scattered and brief inscriptions from the Levant. Egyptian influence is seen as a stimulus in its conception and as a factor in the materials and direction of writing. By 1000 B.C. this simple and flexible system was well-established, supplanting its local rivals, and ready for its expansion eastwards through Aramaic and for its adaptation by the Greeks in the west where it came to its maturity.},

abstract = {From the reviews: The book is, in spite of the author's more modest claims, an introductory survey of main developments in those disciplines which were particularly important in Medieval Islamic mathematics...No knowledge of mathematics (or of the history of mathematics) beyond normal high-school level is presupposed, and everything required beyond that (be it Apollonian theory of conics or the definitions of celestial circles) is explained carefully and clearly. Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general. The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general. - Jens H{\o}yrup, Mathematical Reviews ...as a textbook, this work is highly commendable...It is definitely the product of a skillful mathematician who has collected over the years a reasonably large number of interesting problems from medieval Arabic mathematics. None of them is pursued to exhaustion, but all of them arranged in such a way, together with accompanying exercises, so that they would engage an active mind and introduce a subject, which I am sure the author agrees with me is, at this stage, very difficult to introduce. - G.Saliba, Zentralblatt},

@article{Haidle2010,
abstract = {Tool use is the main database to track down behavioral developments in the archaeological record and thus human evolution. Working-memory capacity and modern cognitive potential, however, are no simple and obvious characters in tool behavior. Coded in cognigrams, which allow a direct comparison, animal and human tool use can be examined for specific aspects of the working-memory capacity. Detailed studies of tool behavior of wasps, sea otters, bottlenose dolphins, and chimpanzees are presented and compared with the manufacture and use of Oldowan tools and Lower Paleolithic spears. Although this shows a wide range of problem-solution distances, problem solving in animals seems to be restricted to problem complexes for which a solution can be found in spatial and temporal vicinity. In human evolution, the complexity of tool behavior increases regarding the number of active foci managed at a time in an action, the number and diversity of operational steps in a problem-solution complex, and the spatial and temporal frame in which solutions are sought. The results suggest a gradual development of the different aspects of a complex capacity instead of a late introduction of a closed phenomenon with only different facets. {\textcopyright} 2010 by The Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research.

abstract = { ABSTRACT ABSTRACTThis essay examines the representation of the city of Rome in Martial's Epigrams, and specifically, his references to urban topography. The city is an insistent and vivid presence in Martial's Epigrams to a degree unparalleled in Roman poetry. He fashions a Rome that is more relentlessly sordid, irregular and jagged in texture, and overtly dissonant in its juxtapositions than the literary cities of his poetic predecessors. This new urban emphasis is not only a game of literary one-upmanship. Martial's urban poetics takes shape in the context of renewed attention to the city and monumental building under the Flavians. },

@article{Heinrich2002,
abstract = {<p>Silicon Valley is frequently portrayed as a manifestation of postindustrial entrepreneurship, where ingenious inventor-businessmen and venture capitalists forged a dynamic, high-tech economy unencumbered by government's “heavy hand.” Closer examination reveals that government played a major role in launching and sustaining some of the region's core industries through military contracting. Focusing on leading firms in the microwave electronics, missile, satellite, and semiconductor industries, this article argues that demand for customized military technology encouraged contractors to embark on a course of flexible specialization, batch production, and continuous innovation. Thriving throughout much of the Cold War, major military contractors fell on hard times when defense markets started to shrink in the late 1980s, because specialized design and production capabilities were rarely applicable to civilian product lines. But Pentagon funding for research and development helped lay the technological groundwork for a new generation of startups, contributing to Silicon Valley's economic renaissance in the 1990s.</p>},

@book{Danesi2017,
abstract = {Emoji have gone from being virtually unknown to being a central topic in internet communication. What is behind the rise and rise of these winky faces, clinking glasses and smiling poos? Given the sheer variety of verbal communication on the internet and English's still-controversial role as lingua mundi for the web, these icons have emerged as a compensatory universal language. The Semiotics of Emoji looks at what is officially the world's fastest-growing form of communication. Emoji, the colourful symbols and glyphs that represent everything from frowning disapproval to red-faced shame, are fast becoming embedded into digital communication. Controlled by a centralized body and regulated across the web, emoji seems to be a language: but is it? The rapid adoption of emoji in such a short span of time makes it a rich study in exploring the functions of language. Professor Marcel Danesi, an internationally-known expert in semiotics, branding and communication, answers the pertinent questions. Are emoji making us dumber? Can they ultimately replace language? Will people grow up emoji literate as well as digitally native? Can there be such a thing as a Universal Visual Language? Read this book for the answers.-- Emoji and writing systems -- Emoji uses -- Emoji competence -- Emoji semantics -- Emoji grammar -- Emoji pragmatics -- Emoji variation -- Emoji spread -- Universal languages -- A communication revolution?},

abstract = {Excavation of the Micoquian site Inden-Altdorf (Weisweiler-124) near the former German capital Bonn in western Germany has revealed the first valid open-site habitation features with hut-like structures and associated hearths for the Middle Palaeolithic in Central Europe. It has been dated to the Eemian interglacial (OIS 5e), a warm interglacial between 128 and 115 ka BP. Various wear traces and especially organic residues have been detected on a large number of stone tools using microscopic use-wear analysis of lithics recovered from the site. A multi-level analysis developed through an experimental framework and archaeological study using optical light microscopes, scanning electron microscopes and energy-dispersive X-ray microprobes identified the adhering residues as birch pitch. Birch pitch is the oldest synthetically produced material and was used as an adhesive to attach lithic implements to wooden shafts. While such hafting technology is commonly associated with modern humans in the Upper Palaeolithic, the birch pitch residues found on the Micoquian tools of Inden-Altdorf suggest that hafting technologies and the frequent use of multi-component tools already existed in the Middle Palaeolithic, c. 120 ka.

abstract = {The paper analyses three preserved reports, depicting Gerbert of Aurillac (also known as: of Reims, of Ravenna, of Bobbio, and in 999–1003 as Pope Sylvester II) as a clockmaker. The Benedictine monk William of Malmesbury (died around 1143) writes about clocks Gerbert made in Reims in The History of the English Kings and describes them as arte mechanica compositum. The Benedictine Arnold Wion (died around 1610) mentions clocks from Ravenna, where Gerbert allegedly constructed a clepsydra, in The Tree of Life. In his Chronicle, Thietmar of Merseburg (died around 1018) describes a horologium with an observation tube (fistula) from Magdeburg. These three references are analysed from a historical standpoint and especially Williams's and Thietmar's short reports are interpreted as possible references to timekeeping devices – the astrolabe and the nocturlabe.},

Whether one is interested in literature or art, philosophy or law, mythology or science, intimate details of daily life or broad cultural and historical trends, the OCD is the first place to turn for clear, authoritative information on all aspects of the ancient world. In over six thousand entries ranging from long articles to brief definitions, the third edition incorporates the insights and interests of a new generation of classical scholars. Readers will find substantial coverage of women in the ancient world with entries on abortion, breastfeeding, and motherhood; sexuality including homosexuality, love and friendship, contraception, and pornography; Asia and the Far East with entries ranging from Gandhara to the Persian Gulf; Jews; and early Christians. In addition, new thematic articles reflect the current emphasis on multidisciplinary approaches to classical studies. These articles include anthropology and the classics, Marxism and classical antiquity, and literary theory and classical studies, while others examine issues of general interest to modern readers such as race, class struggle, ethnicity, alcoholism, incest, propaganda, suicide, the Greek concept of pollution, and much more.},

@article{Agrillo2007Fish,
abstract = {The ability in animals to count and represent different numbers of objects has received a great deal of attention in the past few decades. Cumulative evidence from comparative studies on number discriminations report obvious analogies among human babies, non-human primates and birds and are consistent with the hypothesis of two distinct and widespread mechanisms, one for counting small numbers (<4) precisely, and one for quantifying large numbers approximately. We investigated the ability to discriminate among different numerosities, in a distantly related species, the mosquitofish, by using the spontaneous choice of a gravid female to join large groups of females as protection from a sexually harassing male. In one experiment, we found that females were able to discriminate between two shoals with a 1:2 numerosity ratio (2 vs. 4, 4 vs. 8 and 8 vs. 16 fish) but failed to discriminate a 2:3 ratio (8 vs. 12 fish). In the second experiment, we studied the ability to discriminate between shoals that differed by one element; females were able to select the larger shoal when the paired numbers were 2 vs. 3 or 3 vs. 4 but not 4 vs. 5 or 5 vs. 6. Our study indicates that numerical abilities in fish are comparable with those of other non-verbal creatures studied; results are in agreement with the hypothesis of the existence of two distinct systems for quantity discrimination in vertebrates.},

A conversation between two tricksters, Coyote and Raven, and the colonized and the colonizers, his narrative takes the form of a canoe journey. Cole draws on traditional Aboriginal knowledge to move away from the western genres that have long contained, shaped, and determined ab/originality. Written in free verse, Coyote and Raven Go Canoeing is meant to be read aloud and breaks new ground by making orality the foundation of its scholarship. Cole moves beyond the rhetoric and presumption of white academic (de/re)colonizers to aboriginal spaces recreated by aboriginal peoples. Rather than employing the traditional western practice of gathering information about exoticized other, demonized other, contained other, Coyote and Raven Go Canoeing is a celebration of aboriginal thought, spirituality, and practice, a sharing of lived experience as First Peoples.},

Humans' ability starts with coarse granularity (distinguishing ratios of numerical quantities of 3:1 or larger), but this becomes increasingly precise over development. This series of experiments demonstrates a role of the subcortex in discriminating numerosities in larger (4:1 or 3:1), but not in smaller ratios. These findings map onto the precision with which newborns evaluate number. Combined with evidence from the development of numerical skills, this study implicates the human subcortex as a possible source of core number knowledge that is both related to phylogenetic numerical competence and serves as the foundation on which more complex ontogenetic numerical skills may be built.},

He it was who [274d] invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters. Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved [274e] or disapproved. The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, “This invention, O king,” said Theuth, “will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.” But Thamus replied, “Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another;"},

abstract = {Autobiography of Mark Twain READER'S EDITION Now Available! Half the Size, All the Twain! ISBN 978052027255"I've struck it!" Mark Twain wrote in a 1904 letter to a friend. "And I will give it away--to you. You will never know how much enjoyment you have lost until you get to dictating your autobiography." Thus, after dozens of false starts and hundreds of pages, Twain embarked on his "Final (and Right) Plan" for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to "talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment"--meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be "dead, and unaware, and indifferent," and that he was therefore free to speak his "whole frank mind." The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone and in honor of the cherished tradition of publishing Mark Twain's works, UC Press is proud to offer for the first time Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography in its entirety and exactly as he left it. This major literary event brings to readers, admirers, and scholars the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended.Editors:Harriet E. Smith, Benjamin Griffin, Victor Fischer, Michael B. Frank, Sharon K. Goetz, Leslie Myrick},

- Clemens asked to invest in the machine in 1879/1880 by Dwight Buell, a jeweller. Invests $2,000 with little hope of getting it back, because he "was always taking little chances like that; and almost always losing by it, too". Prescient!


- Machine that Twain saw could set and distribute type from a galley of "dead matter", but could not justify; this was done by an assistant. 3,000 ems an hour, or about 4 times faster than manual composition. Adds another $3,000.


- Clemens wrote that Paige was "a most extraordinary compound of business thrift and commercial insanity; of cold calculation and jejeune sentimentality; of veracity and falsehood; of fidelity and treachery; of nobility and baseness; of pluck and cowardice; of wasteful liberality and pitiful stinginess; of solid sense and weltering moonshine; of towering genius and trivial ambitions; of merciful bowels and a petrified heart; of colossal vanity."


- "He has worked at his expensive machine for more than twenty years, but always at someone else's cost."

address = {Oxford},
annote = {(private-note)noun the sign (-) used to join words to indicate that they have a combined meaning or that they are linked in the grammar of a sentence (as in a pick-me-up, rock-forming minerals), to indicate the division of a word at the end of a line, or to indicate a missing element (as in short- and long-term). Origin: early 17th century: via late Latin from Greek huphen &#039;together&#039;, from hupo &#039;under&#039; + hen &#039;one&#039; In modern English the use of hyphens is in general decreasing, especially in compound nouns: website is preferred to web-site, and air raid to air-raid. Hyphens are still often employed where a compound expression precedes a noun, as in first-rate musicians or twenty-odd people (twenty odd people means something quite different!), but even in this context there is a growing trend to omit them. When a phrasal verb such as build up is made into a noun it is usually hyphenated (a build-up of pressure). Note, however, that a normal phrasal verb should not be hyphenated: write food to take away not food to take-away, and continue to build up your pension not continue to build-up your pension.},

@article{doi:10.1098/rsfs.2016.0035,
abstract = {Our objective was to use expectancy-violation methods for determining whether Portia africana, a salticid spider that specializes in eating other spiders, is proficient at representing exact numbers of prey. In our experiments, we relied on this predator's known capacity to gain access to prey by following pre-planned detours. After Portia first viewed a scene consisting of a particular number of prey items, it could then take a detour during which the scene went out of view. Upon reaching a tower at the end of the detour, Portia could again view a scene, but now the number of prey items might be different. We found that, compared with control trials in which the number was the same as before, Portia's behaviour was significantly different in most instances when we made the following changes in number: 1 versus 2, 1 versus 3, 1 versus 4, 2 versus 3, 2 versus 4 or 2 versus 6. These effects were independent of whether the larger number was seen first or second. No significant effects were evident when the number of prey changed between 3 versus 4 or 3 versus 6. When we changed prey size and arrangement while keeping prey number constant, no significant effects were detected. Our findings suggest that Portia represents 1 and 2 as discrete number categories, but categorizes 3 or more as a single category that we call ‘many'.},

We conducted two between-subjects studies (lab study: n=53; field study: n=41) comparing EmojiAuth to standard PIN entry. We find that EmojiAuth provides good memorability for short passwords and reasonable memorability for longer passwords. Moreover, we identify diverse Emoji-password selection strategies and provide insights on the practical security of Emoji-based mobile authentication. Our results suggest that Emoji-based authentication constitutes a practical alternative to traditional PIN authentication.},

abstract = {The records of a suit brought against Johann Gutenberg in 1439 indicate that he had placed himself under contract to instruct two citizens of Strasbourg in a secret process out of which the three of them expected a considerable profit. Testimony of various witnesses about a press, the melting of "forms," and the supplying to Gutenberg of "material relating to 'printing,' " has led many scholars to propose that Gutenberg was experimenting with printing, but no Strasbourg printing has survived. It is proposed that equipment and supplies mentioned in the suit were used in diecasting and finishing punches for use on leather or soft metals, a process from which Gutenberg later developed type-casting, a key element in his system of book production.},

@article{5057767,
abstract = {In the control and protective circuits of complex electrical systems it is frequently necessary to make intricate interconnections of relay contacts and switches. Examples of these circuits occur in automatic telephone exchanges, industrial motor-control equipment, and in almost any circuits designed to perform complex operations automatically. In this article a mathematical analysis of certain of the properties of such networks will be made. Particular attention will be given to the problem of network synthesis. Given certain characteristics, it is required to find a circuit incorporating these characteristics. The solution of this type of problem is not unique and methods of finding those particular circuits requiring the least number of relay contacts and switch blades will be studied. Methods will also be described for finding any number of circuits equivalent to a given circuit in all operating characteristics. It will be shown that several of the well-known theorems on impedance networks have roughly analogous theorems in relay circuits. Notable among these are the delta-wye ($\delta$-Y) and star-mesh transformations, and the duality theorem.},

abstract = {Numeracy and writing constitute different phenomena, whose paths of formation often appear intertwined. Here we reassess the theory that numeracy evolved universally from a concrete to an abstract concept of number, and that that shift is correlated with the invention of writing. First, we gather contemporary linguistic data and early Mesopotamian epigraphic evidence that indicates that the ‘concrete' vs. ‘abstract' dichotomy is not useful to understand the emergence of numbers. Then, we discuss evidence from other regions where writing was probably invented independently, in order to investigate the conceptualization and formation of early numerical notations.

Born into a wealthy Philadelphia family whose members collected everything from paintings and tapestries to silver and china, Harry began serious book collecting while an undergraduate at Harvard. Starting with first editions of the authors he loved – Charles Dickens, Robert Louis Stevenson, William Makepeace Thackeray – he soon branched out into extra-illustrated and costume books (inspired by his days as a Hasty Pudding Club member), original drawings, and manuscripts.

By age 25, he was well ensconced in the book collecting world of his day, belonging to the Grolier Club and the Bibliophile Society, and in close contact with Philadelphia book dealer Dr. A.S.W. Rosenbach and New York book dealer Luther Livingston. By this time, too, he definitely had developed a philosophy of collecting, as he wrote to Livingston on May 6, 1910: “No matter how important a book or ms may be I only want those that interest me.”},

@book{Danesi2017EmojiUses,
abstract = {Emoji have gone from being virtually unknown to being a central topic in internet communication. What is behind the rise and rise of these winky faces, clinking glasses and smiling poos? Given the sheer variety of verbal communication on the internet and English's still-controversial role as lingua mundi for the web, these icons have emerged as a compensatory universal language. The Semiotics of Emoji looks at what is officially the world's fastest-growing form of communication. Emoji, the colourful symbols and glyphs that represent everything from frowning disapproval to red-faced shame, are fast becoming embedded into digital communication. Controlled by a centralized body and regulated across the web, emoji seems to be a language: but is it? The rapid adoption of emoji in such a short span of time makes it a rich study in exploring the functions of language. Professor Marcel Danesi, an internationally-known expert in semiotics, branding and communication, answers the pertinent questions. Are emoji making us dumber? Can they ultimately replace language? Will people grow up emoji literate as well as digitally native? Can there be such a thing as a Universal Visual Language? Read this book for the answers.-- Emoji and writing systems -- Emoji uses -- Emoji competence -- Emoji semantics -- Emoji grammar -- Emoji pragmatics -- Emoji variation -- Emoji spread -- Universal languages -- A communication revolution?},

abstract = {Two stone flakes partly covered in birch-bark-tar and a third without tar on it were discovered in fluvial gravel and clay in central Italy, in association with the bones of a young adult female Elephas (Palaeoloxondon) antiquus and several micromammals. The probable chronology of the stone flakes is compatible with the late Middle Pleistocene suggested by the site's small mammals and geological context. The fauna indicates a cool stadial episode before isotope stage 6. That age means the flakes are the oldest ever found hafted with tar and indicate a greater capacity for late Middle Pleistocene hominins to utilize raw materials available during cold phases.},

The products these groups developed instigated a global revolution in the watch industry and gave everyone, whether they needed it or not, access to the split-second accuracy once available only to scientists and technicians. This radical change in timekeeping technology was in the vanguard of a dramatic shift from a mechanical to an electronic world and raises important issues about technological change for scholars interested in late twentieth-century history. Examining the work of three teams of engineers, this paper offers a comparative approach to understanding how local differences in culture, economy, business structure and access to technological knowledge shaped the design of finished products and their acceptance by users.},

@article{10.2307/41999837,
abstract = {The recognition of intentional heat treatment of stone artifacts in the archaeological record has been a major research topic since the initial study by Crab tree and Butler (1964). Ethnographic and archaeological records reveal two methods of intentional thermal alteration: controlled heat treatment most commonly used to enhance the flaking quality of stone, and thermal shock fracturing often applied to produce angularfacets on rounded nodules of tough lithologies. During controlled heat treatment, the stone was heated slowly and evenly to the temperature needed to bring about the desired flaking properties, which become more like those of high quality lithologies like obsidian. The response of a lithology to heat treatment is variable, and the same improvements in flaking properties can be accomplished by a variety of heating and cooling rates, provided the heating/cooling is not too rapid and a maximum temperature (350-400°C for cherts) is not exceeded. The improved workability makes soft hammer and pressure flaking more efficient, allowing greater conservation of raw material and manufacture ofextensively retouched tools. Controlled thermal alteration was normally applied to microcrystalline silicious materials; it began in the Middle Palaeolithic (around 110,000 - 90,000 B.P.) and was widespread around the world, butin most areas it became obsolete in the Early Bronze Age. Heat-treated artifacts can be recognised by a marked luster increase, particularly a high contrast between lustrous and non-lustrous fracture surfaces. Color changes during heating, generally towards more reddish hues, are less consistent. Heat treatment results in reduced fracture toughness of microcrystalline siliceous materials; this can be readily identified by mechanical testing. Quartz grains recrystallize and become more equigranular during heat treatment, allowing fractures to propagate more readily and accounting for the enhanced knappability. In addition, healing ofmicrocracks may occur in very fine-grained siliceous materials.},

@article{Regert2004,
abstract = {Although organic materials are very sensitive to biochemical alteration processes, they may be preserved for millennia in various archaeological contexts. Remains of adhesives made during prehistory were discovered at different sites, in the form of residues adhering to flint tools and ceramic vessels or as free lumps in sediment. To characterise the natural substances exploited for adhesive production during late prehistory, we undertook GC and GC/MS analysis of 90 samples from 8 sites dating from the Neolithic to Iron Age periods. This paper discusses our approach to the study of organic adhesives preserved in archaeological contexts, with a particular focus on the presentation of the various categories of organic adhesives that we analysed and the choice of chromatographic conditions adapted to the specificity of such samples. The results obtained show that birch bark tar, a triterpenoid adhesive made by destructive distillation of white birch bark, was predominantly used during the neolithic period even though other materials such as various barks or organic fossil substance were also used. During the Bronze and Iron ages, which follow the Neolithic period, adhesive production is evolving through the expansion of the range of the natural substances used (identification of diterpenoid pine resin) and the addition of beeswax as a plasticiser to birch bark tar. By combining chromatographic analysis and archaeological data, it was thus possible to follow the evolution of adhesive making at the end of prehistory, testifying to the inventiveness of the craftsmen whatever the period considered.},

abstract = {From the reviews: The book is, in spite of the author's more modest claims, an introductory survey of main developments in those disciplines which were particularly important in Medieval Islamic mathematics...No knowledge of mathematics (or of the history of mathematics) beyond normal high-school level is presupposed, and everything required beyond that (be it Apollonian theory of conics or the definitions of celestial circles) is explained carefully and clearly. Scattered throughout the work are a number of lucid remarks on the character of Islamic mathematics or of mathematical work in general. The book will hence not only be an excellent textbook for the teaching of the history of mathematics but also for the liberal art aspect of mathematics teaching in general. - Jens H{\o}yrup, Mathematical Reviews ...as a textbook, this work is highly commendable...It is definitely the product of a skillful mathematician who has collected over the years a reasonably large number of interesting problems from medieval Arabic mathematics. None of them is pursued to exhaustion, but all of them arranged in such a way, together with accompanying exercises, so that they would engage an active mind and introduce a subject, which I am sure the author agrees with me is, at this stage, very difficult to introduce. - G.Saliba, Zentralblatt},

@article{10.2307/4089030,
abstract = {I presented four groups of Common Ravens (Corvus corax) with a problem that they had never encountered before. Could they demonstrate the solution to this problem without first practicing or learning the correct sequence of intermediary steps? The problem posed was the reaching of food suspended by a string. The solution required perching above the string and the food, reaching down, pulling up a loop of string, setting the looped-up string onto the perch, stepping onto the string, releasing the string with the bill while simultaneously applying pressure with the foot onto it, then reaching down again to repeat the cycle six to eight times in that precise order before finally securing a piece of dried meat. The results varied enormously between individuals. However, typically a bird approached the string nervously, pecked or briefly yanked on the string, repeated the approach when given another opportunity, extinguished the approach behavior, or suddenly did the entire string-pulling sequence correctly. One of the wild birds performed the entire sequence correctly on his first approach to the string, even though no other bird of that group had shown the behavior. After a bird had acquired the behavior it thereafter performed the behavior correctly without fail. Other behaviors were associated with successful string pulling. From their first trial, the four hand-reared individuals dropped the meat attached to string (and perch) if they were shooed from the perch. In contrast, other birds that were handed the food attached to string attempted to fly off with it, and it required five to nine trials before they refused to do so, apparently learning the consequences of this behavior. Other problems related to food presented on the dangling string also were solved without first overtly trying out the alternatives. These problems involved: (1) crossing the string with food with another string that held a rock; (2) using a novel string with food, next to the previously-rewarded "old" string; and (3) having food on string next to a rock on string, but with insertion of the string on the perch now displaced laterally. In contrast, the birds performed very poorly at some tasks where simple trial-and-error learning quickly would have resulted in appropriate responses. For example, three birds never once (in 79 trials) pulled the correct string in the crossed-strings experiments that another mustered with no trials. The results are discussed in terms of possible insight and alternative mechanisms, including innate behavior and learning.},

@article{Lieberman1980,
abstract = {Small regularly shaped clay objects and hollow clay bullae have come to recent attention as possible precursors to the invention of writing in the ancient Near East. The interpretation of these objects as accounting devices has found primary textual support in cuneiform documents excavated in ancient Nuzi which are considerably later than the objects. This article provides documentation for the use of such objects in earlier times, in Sumer, where writing is thought to have originated. The relevance of the manipulation of such calculi to the prehistory of the cuneiform system of numbers is explored. A differentiation in usage between curviform and cuneiform numerals beginning in pre-Sargonic times and continuing into the Ur III period is seen as a reflection of actual use of the clay calculi in accounting, and bureaucratic practice is inferred from the representational distinction. Sumero-Akkadian lexicons which apparently list clay calculi among other bookkeeping devices are interpreted as showing that the Sumerian word for "clay calculus" was /imna/, "clay stone." In the light of this new evidence for the use of the small clay objects, the theory which sees them as antecedent to script is assessed. The hypothesis is deemed unjustified on chronological and geographical grounds, imprecise or incorrect in terms of many of the purely formal comparisons which have been made, inadequate as an explanation of the appearance of writing, and based on an error in classification.},

@incollection{Safire2008Line,
abstract = {When it comes to the vagaries of language in American politics, its uses and abuses, its absurdities and ever-shifting nuances, its power to confound, obscure, and occasionally to inspire, William Safire is the language maven we most readily turn to for clarity, guidance, and penetrating, sometimes lacerating, wit. Safire's Political Dictionary is a stem-to-stern updating and expansion of the Language of Politics, which was first published in 1968 and last revised in 1993, long before such terms as Hanging Chads, 9/11 and the War on Terror became part of our everyday vocabulary. Nearly every entry in that renowned work has been revised and updated and scores of completely new entries have been added to produce an indispensable guide to the political language being used and abused in America today. Safire's definitions--discursive, historically aware, and often anecdotal--bring a savvy perspective to our colorful political lingo. Indeed, a Safire definition often reads like a mini-essay in political history, and readers will come away not only with a fuller understanding of particular words but also a richer knowledge of how politics works, and fails to work, in America. From Axis of Evil, Blame Game, Bridge to Nowhere, Triangulation, and Compassionate Conservatism to Islamofascism, Netroots, Earmark, Wingnuts and Moonbats, Slam Dunk, Doughnut Hole, and many others, this language maven explains the origin of each term, how and by whom and for what purposes it has been used or twisted, as well as its perceived and real significance. For anyone who wants to cut through the verbal haze that surrounds so much of American political discourse, Safire's Political Dictionary offers a work of scholarship, wit, insiderhood and resolute bipartisanship.},

abstract = {We often take punctuation for granted, but its evolution has been largely responsible for our ability to communicate meaning and convey emphasis with the written word. Believing that the best way to understand usage is to study it historically, Parkes focuses on how marks have actually been used. He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians. It is destined to become a standard reference work for anyone interested in the history and use of language.},

abstract = {On ancient Egyptian artifacts, paint containing Egyptian blue pigment is often found to have become brownish green or even black. Darkened paints from several coffins have been investigated using gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC/MS) and other methods, to identify the cause of the discoloration. Different phenomena have been seen: one type of discoloration involved the browning of gum arabic throughout the paint layer; other examples showed surface discoloration in the varnish, the paint underneath being still bright blue. Surface dirt also contributes to darkening. Artificial aging of paints demonstrated that gum arabic binder can discolour sufficiently for paint to appear black. The poor hiding power and transparency of Egyptian blue contribute to the overall dark appearance.},

More specifically, I want to show how the rewriting of history and the invention of tradition impact material objects and our beliefs about them. I focus here on the transmission history of the mechanical calculator invented by the German savant Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Leibniz repeatedly described his machine as functional and wonderfully useful, but in reality it was never finished and didn't fully work. Its internal structure also remained unknown. In 1879, however, the machine re-emerged and was reinvented as the origin of all later calculating machines based on the stepped drum, to protect the priority of the German Leibniz against the Frenchman Thomas de Colmar as the father of mechanical calculation. The calculator was later replicated to demonstrate that it could function 'after all', in an effort to deepen this narrative and further enhance Leibniz's computing acumen.},

Drawing on the latest archaeological evidence and historical studies, the book examines the chronological development and technical details of handmills, beast mills, watermills and windmills from the first millennium BCE to c. 1500. It discusses the many and varied uses to which mills were turned in the civilisations of Rome, China, Islam and Europe, and the many types of mill that existed. The book also includes comparative regional studies of the social and economic signifance of milling, and tackles several important historiographical issues, such as whether technological stagnation was a characteristic of late Antiquity, whether there was an "industrial revolution" in the European Middle Ages based on waterpower, and how contemporary studies in the social shaping of technology can shed light on the study of pre-modern technology.},

abstract = {For the first time, all five of John Napier's works have been brought together in English in a single volume, making them more accessible than ever before. His four mathematical works were originally published in Latin: two in his lifetime (1550--1617), one shortly after he died, and one over 200 years later. The authors have prepared three introductory chapters, one covering Napier himself, one his mathematical works, and one his religious work. The former has been prepared by one of Napier's descendants and contains many new findings about Napier's life to provide the most complete biography of this enigmatic character, whose reputation has previously been overshadowed by rumour and speculation. The latter has been written by an academic who was awarded a PhD for his thesis on Napier at the University of Edinburgh, and it provides the most lucid and coherent coverage available of this abstruse and little understood work. The chapter on Napier's mathematical texts has been authored by an experienced and respected academic, whose recent works have specialised in the history of mathematics and whose Journey through Mathematics was selected in March of 2012 as an Outstanding Title in Mathematics by Choice magazine, a publication of the American Library Association. All three authors have revisited the primary sources extensively and deliver new insights about Napier and his works, whilst revising the many myths and assumptions that surround his life and character.},

abstract = {The danger to persons exposed to nuclear radiations from fission products deposited after an atomic explosion cannot be fully estimated from a measurement of the ionization dose-rate at any particular time. This is because the intensity of ionization from fission products decreases continually, and the rate of decrease depends on the age of the fission products. Thus the total dose received by anyone is less than would be expected if allowance is not made for the decay of dose-rate during the period of exposure. A slide-rule is described by means of which this decay can be allowed for quickly and accurately. By its use, all problems of external radiation dose received from decaying fission products may be rapidly solved.},

Stone tools manufactured about 2.5 million years ago were found at Gona, and cut-marked bones of about the same age were found in the Middle Awash. The suspicion that hominins used tools even earlier has now been borne out by the discovery at nearby Dikika of two bones, one from a large ungulate, with cut and percussion marks consistent with the use of stone tools to remove flesh and extract bone marrow. The marked bones are about 3.4 million years old and are probably the work of Australopithecus afarensis, the only hominin known to have been in the Awash Valley at this time, and famously the species to which the iconic Lucy (from Hadar, Ethiopia) and the juvenile Selam (or DIK-1-1, from Dikika) belong.},

abstract = {Dan Bricklin and Bob Frankston discuss the creation of VisiCalc, the pioneering spreadsheet application. Bricklin and Frankston begin by discussing their educational backgrounds and experiences in computing, especially with MIT's Multics system. Bricklin then worked for DEC on typesetting and word-processing computers and, after a short time with a small start-up company, went to Harvard Business School. After MIT Frankston worked for White Weld and Interactive Data. The interview examines many of the technical, design, and programming choices in creating VisiCalc as well as interactions with Dan Fylstra and several business advisors. Bricklin comments on entries from his dated notebooks about these interactions. The interview reviews the incorporation of Software Arts in 1979, then describes early marketing of VisiCalc and the value of product evangelizing. There is discussion of rising competition from Mitch Kapor's 1-2-3 and the steps taken by Fylstra's software publishing company Personal Software (later VisiCorp). Part II of the interview begins with Bricklin and Frankston's use of a Prime minicomputer to compile VisiCalc's code for the Apple II computer. There is discussion of connections to Apple Computer and DEC, as well as publicity at the West Coast Computer Faire. The two evaluate the Fylstra essay, reviewing the naming of VisiCalc and discussing the division of labor between software developers and Fylstra as a software publisher. They describe the porting of code for versions of VisiCalc for other computers. Talks concerning a possible merger between Personal Software and Software Arts broke down, and instead there was a lawsuit between the companies. Software Arts developed a new product called TK!Solver and became a Macintosh developer. They evaluate the early spreadsheet products, including Kapor's 1-2-3, Context MBA, Multiplan, and Excel as well as VisiCalc for the IBM PC. There is discussion of the Xerox PARC Alto and Macintosh. The interview was conducted in two parts, first with Martin Campbell-Kelly and the second with Paul Ceruzzi. There are references to an essay prepared by Dan Fylstra, circulated privately at the 2004 meeting and subsequently posted on the web (see "The Creation and Destruction of VisiCalc" in footnote below).},

He also places the tumultuous events in the context of history and demonstrates how they set Japan on a path to even greater tragedy: the massive, American-led relief effort seemed to promise a bright new era in U.S.-Japanese relations, but, Hammer asserts, the calamity led in fact to a hardening of racist attitudes in both Japan and the United States, and drove Japan into the hands of radical militarists with imperial ambitions.--From publisher description.},

abstract = {In the English language, the probability of encountering the rth most common word is given roughly by P(r)=0.1/r for r up to 1000 or so. The law breaks down for less frequent words, since the harmonic series diverges. Pierce's (1980, p. 87) statement that sumP(r)>1 for r=8727 is incorrect. Goetz states the law as follows: The frequency of a word is inversely proportional to its statistical rank r such that P(r) approx 1/(rln(1.78R)), where R is the number of different words.},

Nonetheless, half a century ago an Italian company concluded what was at the time the largest-ever foreign takeover of a US company. The paper analyzes the Olivetti's acquisition of Underwood and frames it in the broader picture of the literature on the management and performance of foreign companies in the United States. We provide a historical narrative focused on three main issues: 1) head office control and subsidiary autonomy; 2) Olivetti's adaptation to the American business system; 3) the development of internal knowledge resources within the subsidiary. Lessons and implications are relevant for business historians and management scholars in general.},

abstract = {We often take punctuation for granted, but its evolution has been largely responsible for our ability to communicate meaning and convey emphasis with the written word. Believing that the best way to understand usage is to study it historically, Parkes focuses on how marks have actually been used. He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians. It is destined to become a standard reference work for anyone interested in the history and use of language.},

abstract = {"Before Palm Pilots and iPods, PCs and laptops, the term "computer" referred to the people who did scientific calculations by hand. These workers were neither calculating geniuses nor idiot savants but knowledgeable people who, in other circumstances, might have become scientists in their own right. When Computers Were Human represents the first in-depth account of this little-known, 200-year epoch in the history of science and technology." "Beginning with the story of his own grandmother, who was trained as a human computer, David Alan Grier provides an introduction to the wider world of women and men who did the hard computational labor of science." "When Computers Were Human is the sad but lyrical story of workers who gladly did the hard labor of research calculation in the hope that they might be part of the scientific community. In the end, they were rewarded by a new electronic machine that took the place and the name of those who were, once, the computers."--Jacket.},

abstract = {The controversy surrounding australopithecine hunting and/or scavenging behavior and the problem of Dart's contended osteodontokeratic culture of Australopithecus prometheus are hardly new issues. Yet most of the contentions on all sides have been speculative, with little firm support. Faunal analysis, when developed as a generalizing, systematic and explicit technique based on a deductively formulated body of hypotheses about cultural adaptations, can shed light on these issues by offering means of testing these ideas logically and empirically. Through discussion of specific examples, such as German reindeer hunting sites and the australopithecine faunal assemblage at Makapansgat, the importance of faunal analysis for reconstructing past human behavior is demonstrated. The fragmented animal remains from the Makapansgat Limeworks Cavern are shown to support Dart's contention that these hominids scavenged from bovids killed by large carnivores and that they often used animal remains as tools. Some implications of the scavenging hypothesis for the evolution of bipedalism are mentioned.},

abstract = {The "Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology" gathers theterms and techniques of archaeology and addresses the uniqueness ofarchaeologists among those looking into the past in that they drawfrom many sources of information. By contrast, historians deal withwritten records and paleontologists study fossilized remains, butarchaeologists deal with all the information that can be obtainedabout the past from all material remains.The "Encyclopedic Dictionary of Archaeology" puts forward andencyclopedic view of the extraordinary world of archaeology and thefascinating techniques used to piece together civilizations of thepast. From traditional to applied archaeology, the data gathered inthis volume may serve as a field manual and resource guide for boththe amateur and the professional. It aims to satisfy a need for anarchaeological work of general reference summarizing what is knownfrom archaeology about human history in all parts of the globe.In defining the terms and techniques of archaeology, the"Encyclopedic" "Dictionary of Archaeology" identifies anddescribes major premises, important concepts, and scientific methodsused in the field. There is a balance of New World and Old Worldcoverage, theory, method, and practice. The work is the largest andmost comprehensive dictionary of its kind with a total of over 7,000entries.},

Contains an English translation of Pliny's few paragraphs on papyrus, including a description of the width of papyrus sheets and their associated qualities.


Pliny's account of the different grades seems confused. Bulow-Jacobsen suggests that the best quality sheets were sometimes pasted into a roll at the start, to fool the buyer into imagining that all the rest were the same.


-------------


Talks about parchment: Pliny quotes Varro as saying that Ptolemy V deliberately banned papyrus exports to Eumenes II because they were competing in building up their libraries. Probably false.

Wax tablets were typically bound along the long edge, but lines were also written parallel to the long edge - when opened, you get a top and bottom page, rather than a left and right page.},

@article{2000,
abstract = {This paper addresses the question of the role of ostracism in democratic Athens. I argue that the frequent expulsion of aristocrats by rival aristocrats in the predemocratic polis is the key to understanding the function of ostracism in the democratic polis. I show that aristocratic "politics of exile" was a fundamental political problem in the archaic polis and that democratic political power, symbolized by the institution of ostracism, was the polis' solution to the problem. In the archaic polis, the expulsion of aristocrats often led to an endless cycle of exiles and returns and consequent political instability. In 508/7, the Athenian demos usurped the power over decisions of exile by banishing Isagoras and recalling Cleisthenes from exile. By taking control of decisions of exile, the Athenian demos took over political power insofar as power over decisions of exile had become synonymous with political power. The creation of the institution of ostracism, whereby the people decided collectively whether to banish a single citizen for ten years, provided not only a mechanism for the symbolic expression of democratic power, but also a means for the practical and ideological distinction between oligarchic and democratic rule. While aristocrats had banished their opponents without limit in numbers and duration of exile, the Athenian democracy decided each year whether to banish a single individual for a limited time period. In most years, the Athenian demos chose not to exercise the power of exile. Nevertheless, the annual question in the assembly served to remind aristocrats that the demos held the fundamental political power, and hence deterred aristocrats from attempting to overthrow the democracy. The limited nature of ostracism further deterred exiled aristocrats from attempting to return by force. Finally, the infrequent and moderate use of exile as a means of resolving political conflict helps to explain the extraordinary stability of the Athenian democracy.},

Here we report a cross-hatched pattern drawn with an ochre crayon on a ground silcrete flake recovered from approximately 73,000-year-old Middle Stone Age levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Our microscopic and chemical analyses of the pattern confirm that red ochre pigment was intentionally applied to the flake with an ochre crayon. The object comes from a level associated with stone tools of the Still Bay techno-complex that has previously yielded shell beads, cross-hatched engravings on ochre pieces and a variety of innovative technologies2–5. This notable discovery pre-dates the earliest previously known abstract and figurative drawings by at least 30,000 years. This drawing demonstrates the ability of early Homo sapiens in southern Africa to produce graphic designs on various media using different techniques.},

@article{10.2307/41496524,
abstract = {Mousterian tools with traces of bitumen on their surfaces discovered at Umm el Tlel (Syria) have been dated to 40,000 years (BP). Until now tools with traces of bitumen were known only from the 8th millennium but this new discovery shows usage 30,000 years earlier. Mousterian complex VI 3, dated to 71,000-72,000 BP, has yielded fragments of black cobbles and eleven Levallois artefacts with traces of black material demonstrated to be bituminous. Herein we present the geochemical and microscopy results on materials from artefact and a cobble. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of both C₁₅₊ alkanes and C₁₅₊ aromatics demonstrates that the black substance is natural asphalt. The source of this asphaltic material or bitumen found on the tools is related to natural outcrops located around 40 km east of Umm el Tlel in the Bichri Massif. For the first time, microscopic analysis of 300 Levallois artefacts with no macro-traces of bitumen visible to the naked eye, has demonstrated that two-thirds of these artefacts have black micro-residues. These micro-traces that were identified on artefacts recovered from a strata in complex VI 3, have been identified as bitumen-bearing following analyses. Thus, rather than being a material used occasionally, bitumen is shown to be of key importance in the technological system of these populations, hypothesized to have been used as an adhesive to attach hafts made of organic matter or bone to tools. These new results extend the oldest known date for the use of natural bitumen by early hominids from 40,000 BP to 71,000 BP and show that older Middle Palaeolithic populations were already acquainted with the use of bitumen as adhesive to attach hafts to flint tools or for other similar uses. La premi{\`{e}}re d{\'{e}}couverte d'outils moust{\'{e}}riens avec des traces de bitume sur leurs surfaces, {\`{a}} Umm el Tlel en Syrie, a {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} dat{\'{e}}e d'avant 40000 ans BP. Ant{\'{e}}rieurement {\`{a}} cette d{\'{e}}couverte, ce type d'outils {\'{e}}tait connu simplement au VIIIe mill{\'{e}}naire BC. Avec ces nouvelles donn{\'{e}}es sur le m{\^{e}}me site, l'utilisation du bitume se trouve repouss{\'{e}}e de 30000 ans. En effet le complexe moust{\'{e}}rien VI 3, dat{\'{e}} de 71000-72000 BP, a livr{\'{e}} des fragments de galets noirs et 11 artefacts Levallois avec des traces de mat{\'{e}}riau noir, identifi{\'{e}}es comme {\'{e}}tant bitumineuses. Nous pr{\'{e}}sentons ici les r{\'{e}}sultats g{\'{e}}ochimiques et microscopiques sur des mat{\'{e}}riaux observ{\'{e}}s dans ou sur des artefacts et des galets. La Chromatographie en phase gazeuse coupl{\'{e}}e {\`{a}} la spectrom{\'{e}}trie de masse (CG-SM) des C₁₅₊ satur{\'{e}}s et C₁₅₊ aromatiques d{\'{e}}montre que cette substance noire est de l'asphalte. La source de ce mat{\'{e}}riau asphaltique ou bitume, pr{\'{e}}sente sur les outils, se trouve dans des affleurements de sables bitumineux, {\`{a}} 40 km de Umm el Tlel dans le massif du Djebel Bichri. Pour la premi{\`{e}}re fois, l'analyse microscopique de 300 artefacts Levallois d{\'{e}}pourvus de macro-traces de bitume visibles {\`{a}} l'{\oe}il nu, a montr{\'{e}} que les deux tiers de ces artefacts avaient des micro-r{\'{e}}sidus noirs. Ces micro-traces, identifi{\'{e}}es sur les artefacts du complexe VI3, ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} identifi{\'{e}}es comme {\'{e}}tant {\`{a}} base de bitume apr{\`{e}}s analyse. Ceci montre que ce mat{\'{e}}riau n'est pas utilis{\'{e}} de fa{\c{c}}on occasionnelle mais joue un r{\^{o}}le de premier plan parmi les connaissances techniques de ces populations, probablement comme adh{\'{e}}sif pour fixer des artefacts sur des manches en mati{\`{e}}re organique ou en os, ou pour ins{\'{e}}rer ces artefacts dans des manchons. Ces nouveaux r{\'{e}}sultats font remonter la plus ancienne date d'utilisation du bitume par des hominid{\'{e}}s de 40000 BP {\`{a}} 70000 BP et montrent donc que des populations plus anciennes, du Pal{\'{e}}olithique Moyen, savaient d{\'{e}}j{\`{a}} utiliser le bitume dans le cadre d'emmanchement ou pour d'autres usages similaires.},

Manufacturers around the world have spent billions of US dollars adopting new technologies, modifying old ones, and developing local innovations to meet rising environmental demands, expectations, and regulations. Additional millions of US dollars have been spent by public and private institutions on research, development, and testing of new nvironmental processes and technologies for the pulp and paper industry (cf.

- John S. Thompson. History of Composing Machines.Two very interesting patents, machines constructed under which were capable of performing the entire cycle of operations of composing, line-justifying, and distributing, were taken out by C. W. Felt in America in 1860 (and in England in 1861) , and that of J. W. Paige taken out in America in 1895. In many respects the earlier patent is the more remarkable for its curious anticipation of much that has followed. The Paige patent is perhaps, as far as size is concerned, the most voluminous ever taken out in the history of invention.
The history of the Paige typesetting machine, which in its final form was named the Paige compositor after the inventor and patentee, is an interesting story of inventive and constructional evolution, several minds being concentrated upon the complex problem of distributing, setting and line-justifying movable type by positive, but controlled, mechanical action.
The authors are indebted for their history of the Paige machine to the distinguished mechanical engineer, Charles E. Davis, who, at an early period in its progress, took over charge and control of the drawings and mechanical engineering work connected with it, and superintended its manufacture from the first stage of development, down to the completion and operation of all the models and machines which were built. The description here given is in his own words.
"J. W. Paige lived in Rochester, New York, and early in the seventies, while interested in the oil fields, conceived the idea of a simple typesetter, and built his first machine to handle agate (5 1/2 - point) type. From the start, the method of handling the type, edge upon edge, as against the universally accepted method of side upon side, was adopted: in other words, the type was always in the order of hand-composition, the same as in the compositor's stick." (Evidently this statement can only refer to American practice as several of the earlier European machines handled their type in this manner.)
"At first no provision was made for distributing from the dead matter for resetting. The final arrangement of the keyboard for setting type by syllables and words (a plan conceived from the first) was the result of an analytical study of the language, covering all subjects, made by Charles G. Van Schuyver, a printer in the employ of Paige, and to his patient work all praise is due. The keyboard was so arranged that there was one, and only one combination available for setting a word or syllable when reading from left to right. During the study of this portion of the problem four variations were tried; first 89 characters, then 141 characters, and then 115. Finally 109 was adopted as the number of the best practical value.
"Early in his work Paige discovered the necessity for a machine which would either distribute the dead matter or recast the type for his typesetting machine. At about this time, the Shanks typecasting machine, a very rapid power-actuated typecasting machine, was invented in England. Paige secured the American rights for this and imported two of these machines for use in connexion with his typesetter.
"While Mr. Paige was working in Rochester, many others were studying the problem, notably J. M. Farnham, of Hartford, Conn., where the manufacture of the Farnham typesetter was in progress, a gravity machine with converging channels using type side upon side. The Farnham Typesetter Company was also developing the Thompson distributor with a view to its use for supplying the Farnham machine by distribution of dead matter.
"About 1877, Dr. George F. Hawley, President of the Farnham Typesetter Company, entered into a contract with Paige to use his typesetter and the Thompson distributor.
"The Farnham Typesetter Company had their own works in the building of the Colt's Firearms Company, which were in charge of E. S. Pierce, as mechanical engineer and superintendent. A few months after the contract had been made with Paige, he produced a plan for a combined typesetting and distributing machine; it was decided to build a machine upon the new lines, and to abandon the separate machines. the new machine was planned upon the lines of the Paige, and used the Thompson principle for necessity of transference. The work progressed rather slowly, and not until about the close 1878, was it possible to show anything tangible; six characters were distributed from a temporary channel into the main type-case, and were set from the same case, thus demonstrating the possibility of the combined type-case.
"It was shortly prior to this period, Pierce having resigned, that the services of Charles E. Davis were secured by those interested in the matter.
"Soon after the test of the principle of the combined machine, various defects in the plan of the mechanism developed, and it was necessary in order to accomplish successfully the desired results to redesign the machine, using only such parts of the mechanism as could be made to meet the required conditions, and it was a this time that the plan was adopted, and never departed from, of working always to figures on fully-dimensioned drawings.
"Some months after the completion of the test referred to, Samuel L. Clemens, better known as Mark Twain, first became interested in the machine through the purchase of stock in the Farnham Typesetter Company, at the solicitation of Dwight Buell. It would be fruitless and tedious history to detail all the delays that followed due to limited capital and other causes. During the period which elapsed up to the time when the first combined machine was completed and used as a composing machine handling brevier type, operated by two men, one at the keyboard, and other to justify the type, Dr. Geo. F. Hawley, William L. Matson, William Hammersley, Samuel Coit, William Gaylord, and many others were identified with the enterprise. It was a difficult task to interest new capital, for at this time no one believed it possible to line-justify automatically and mechanically a line of movable type. Delay occurred until Paige conceived the idea of a printing-telegraph, operated by his combined keyboard, to be used either with Morse or Roman characters, as a quick means of raising money to enable the composing machine to be proceeded with. Several of these printing-telegraph machines were built, Samuel Coit being largely instrumental in furnishing the money, and Clemens being also called in to assist in the matter.
"It was while following the telegraph instrument that Clemens renewed his interest in the composing machine, and quite a number of his MSS. were set up on the machine. While the work on the telegraph instrument was in progress, Charles R. North, a skilled mechanic in the employ of Paige, invented an automatic justifier to work in combination with the Paige machine. After this matter had been presented to Clemens and a detailed estimate made at his request by experts from the Pratt and Whitney Company, covering the cost of building the first combined machine and its subsequent manufacture, he decided to undertake the responsibility for the construction of a new machine, combining North's Justifier with the Paige Typesetter and Distributor; for this purpose he deposited the first royalties received by him from the publication on of his wonderfully successful book 'Huckleberry Finn.'
"With Whitmore as Clemens's financial representative work was commenced with Carl Crohmann, Chas. I. Earle and others as assistants in the engineering department' drawings were furnished to the Pratt and Whitney Company, and the machine was built at their works in Flower Street, Hartford, Conn., George A. Bates acting as their foreman.
"A grave error was made at this point which caused trouble later on; many parts of the first combined machine were used in the construction of the new machine, with the result that when the new machine was completed and in operation it contained features which prevented its use as a model upon which to base a plant for manufacturing. The machine as built at the Pratt and Whitney works, was, however, a successful machine in its operation, and demonstrated the possibilities of distributing movable type dead matter, and simultaneously setting, line-justifying, and assemblying in column-form life matter on a single, power-driven, positive-action machine, operated by one man.
"It was when this result had been achieved that Clemens said one day: 'We only need one more thing, a phonograph on the distributor to yell, "Where in H_____ is the printer's devil, I want more type." ' The late Dr. Thurston, the eminent mechanical engineer, said when he saw the machine in operation: 'This is thought crystallized:' and it was Theodore De Vinne of the Century Company who said, when somebody compared the Paige compositor to the Jacquard loom: 'True, but the Paige compositor unravels any old fabric, and from it reweaves any new design which the imagination of man can conceive.'
"Upon the completion of the Paige compositor at the works of the Pratt and Whitney Company, all the leading newspapers and publishing housed expressed their confidence in the project, and were ready to contract for its use. It was at this stage that George S. Mallory and Marshall H. Mallory undertook to finance the enterprise. The capital required was, however, large and the reason the Paige compositor was never manufactured was due to the fact that at this time Paige, who controlled the patents, refused to part with a sufficient interest to induce other capitalists to invest the large amount required to conduct the business successfully, and was not attributable to any mechanical failure or defect in the machine. In this way three years were lost. It was during these three years that Philip T. Dodge assumed control of the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, and by a very successfully drawn contract with the newspapers and publishing houses, practically secured control of their composing rooms, and placed the Mergenthaler Company in a position to set the price at which the Paige machine could be marketed.
"Finally, in 1892, Ward, Frink, and Kneval of New York formed the Compositor Company, and contracted with the Webster Manufacturing Company, of Chicago, to build the machines, and the first compositor and the enterprise were moved from Hartford to Chicago in that year. An addition to the Webster factory was built, and a force of draughtsmen and mechanics employed to redesign and build a model machine.
"Again there were delays owing to the lack of funds, and although every effort was put forth to complete the machine in time for exhibition at the World's Fair, it was not ready, and late in the fall of 1893 work was stopped. Once more Clemens came into the breach, and through his influence Henry H. Rogers became interested and the Regius Company was formed, a concern which subsequently became the Paige Compositor Company. Work was resumed and the machine carried to completion. When the Compositor Company went to Chicago, Mr. Scott, manager of the "Chicago Herald," agreed to test the machine on the "Herald." In September, 1894, the compositor was erected in the "Herald" office, and although it had not been tested on dead matter from which stereotype matrices had been made, a sixty days' run was started on copy taken from the 'hook.' For this test neither machinery nor repair tools were allowed to be erected. Any work that required to be done had to be taken to the company's works two and a half miles away. During this test two or three radical changes were necessary, but even in the face of this handicap the Paige compositor, with all delays counted against it, delivered more corrected live matter to the imposing stone, ready for the formes, per operator employed, than any one of the thirty-two Linotype machine which were in operation in the same composing department, although the latter had had several years' use on newspaper work. This record may fairly claim never to have been equaled by any composing machine on its maiden trial; moreover, the composition which the compositor turned out was, in artistic merit, equal to the finest book-work ever set by hand.
"The Paige compositor has been pronounced by competent engineers to be the foremost example of cam mechanism ever produced in the United States, if not in the whole world and to have performed by positive mechanical devices the largest amount of brain labour ever undertaken.
"Some conception of the problem may be had if we follow the various operations required to deliver a finished column of live matter.
"After coming from the forme the dead matter was made up in the galleys for distribution. These galleys were inserted in he machine without a stop, and the top line was raised and advanced towards the front of the machine for the separation of the individual types. The type were then separated from the line by a mechanism, which handled them as required in composition. When separated the type were raised a short distance, and a series of tests was automatically made to remove wide type, broken or cracked type, dirt or foreign matter of any kind, and to pass along into the distributing mechanism only such type as were perfect for resetting. Distribution was made possible by a series of nicks. Here again the greatest care was necessary so that no two different type had the same nicks, and that it was not possible for a type which had been broken in any way to cause a wrong distribution. All quads and spaces were so nicked that if reversed they would still distribute correctly. The selecting mechanism was so arranged that it would detect two type that might become stuck together in stereotyping; if they reached the body of the machine were thrown out, and the distribution was automatically stopped until these type were removed. Whenever any particular magazine channel became full, the feed stopped automatically until the type had been set out of that channel, or until any excess of sorts in that channel had been removed by special pincers provided for that purpose. During the whole operation of distributing, the movement of the type progressed towards the right, and of the justifying spaces towards the left of the machine, and of both forward towards the operator.
"When the type in process of distribution was moved forward into the place of the common type-case, a lifting mechanism removed the type from the end of the forwarding plunger, and lifted and placed it upon a supporting shelf at the bottom of the channel from which the type was taken in composing, so that it was possible in the machine to distribute a type into the magazine and set the same type out of the magazine during the same revolution of the cam-shaft. This distribution continued until any one channel became filled up by the insertion of some 200 characters, when a weight carried on top of the column of type in the channel came into contact with the mechanism which stopped the feed of the machine. The operator at the keyboard could set out syllables and words into a race in which a collector operated for transferring the type set to the line of composition. During composition the movement of the type was again towards the front of the machine, but the subsequent movements were towards the left instead of towards the right. At this point the operation of the automatic justification of the type commenced, the mechanical problem with the machine solved, being as follows: after adjustment to a predetermined length of line of composition, the machine automatically measured the words and symbols as set up by the operator, added the sum of these measurements together, subtracted the sum from the length of the line required, divided the remainder by the number of words less one, and automatically selected a space, or a combination of spaces, for insertion in the line which would justify the line within the limit of 0.005 inch. When a word had been composed and delivered to the line by a collecting mechanism in the type raceway, a key was touched which caused another mechanism to operate positively in harmony with the remainder of the machine, and to move the word forward a sufficient distance to allow another word to follow: no spaces were inserted in the line at this stage. This press continued until the indicator showed the operator that the line in process of composition had reached a length which would not permit of the setting of another syllable or word. The operator then touched a key known as the line-key, and mechanism was brought into operation to send each of the words forward in harmony with the other words previously set in the line in such way that when the first word in the line passed the justifying case - which was a duplicate in principle of the regular type-case, but located some distance to the left - the points of this mechanism acted as an automatic key for inserting in place the space or spaces which would justify the line. When the last word of the line passed the case no space was inserted and a mechanism was automatically brought into play for moving the completed line forward ready for insertion into the live-matter galley. At this stage provision was made for automatically inserting one, two, or three leads into the column of live matter, before the line of type, which had now been justified, was moved downward; by this means it was possible for the operator at the keyboard to set either solid, single, double, or treble leaded matter at his discretion into the live-matter column. This live matter was placed in galley ready for removal to the proof galley, and from thence, after correction, to the imposing stone.
"One very important, in fact the most important element in connexion with this machine was what was termed the 'time-lock'; this was purely mechanical in construction, simple in formation, yet so designed that it was possible for the operator to finger the keyboard without regard to the beat of the machine while the positive mechanism of the machine would operate so as to perform all its various functions without interference one with the other, and without danger of knife-edge contacts or damage to the mechanisms. It is true that there were a large number of mechanisms in the machine, but the subject had been so carefully worked out and charted that even an operator who was not familiar with the machine, by simply looking at the degrees shown on the indicator dial, could, by reference to the chart, know exactly what mechanisms were in operation at that particular time, and so be able to locate accurately any difficulties that might have arisen, or which might have caused the machine to stop automatically; this it did whenever any undue strain was applied to any of the mechanisms.
"The speed of the machine shaft was 220 revolutions per minute. At this speed it was possible to distribute approximately 7500 ems (15,000 ens) of solid matter per hour, and it was possible for an expert operator to set up and justify over 9000 ems (18,000 ens) per hour, and 12,000 ems (24,000 ens) on rush matter; under these conditions, however, more frequent sorting of the case would be necessary, and provision was made for its easy accomplishment by the glass front of the case being spring-balanced, and so arranged that the removal of two screws, each turned one-half turn, would permit the case to be opened down to the bottom type.
"After the completion of the test at the offices of the "Chicago Herald," the matter of the continuation of the manufacture was thoroughly discussed, and a report was made on the mechanical reliability of the machine, which was favourable in every way. At one time the Mergenthaler Linotype Company had offered to exchange half-interests with the proprietors of the Paige machine, but Paige would not accept this offer. During the three years of delay the Mergenthaler Linotype Company had secured the field in such a way as to be able to fix the price of the Paige machine, and this caused the capitalists to come to the decision that money could be made faster in other channels than in the manufacture of the Paige machine. As a consequence, about two years later Philip T. Dodge purchased the patents and the two machines for the Mergenthaler Linotype Company, who loaned to the Cornell University the machine manufactured in Chicago and tested in the "Chicago Herald" office, and to the Columbia University, in New York, the machine manufactured in Hartford by the Pratt and Whitney Company, and at these universities they are now."
The Paige compositor used on the "Chicago Herald" test, was approximately eleven feet in length, three and one half feet wide, and six feet high. It weighted about 5000 pounds, and the power required was transmitted through 1/4-inch round belt to a grooved pulley 14 inches in diameter; it consumed about 1/4 to 1/3 horse-power. It could be started and turned up to speed with one finger at a 7-inch leverage. It was specially designed for newspaper work, and used nonpareil type; the distributing, setting, justifying, and leading mechanisms were},

THORP n.: see note below).The term was reportedly coined in the early 1960s by Don Macpherson, an employee of Bell Laboratories:1996 Telecom Heritage No. 28. 53 His thought process was as follows: There are eight points on the symbol so octo should be part of the name. We need a few more letters or another syllable to make a noun... (Don Macpherson..was active in a group that was trying to get Jim Thorpe's Olympic medals returned from Sweden). The phrase thorpe would be unique. For an alternative explanation see quot. 1996; in a variant of this explanation, the word is explained as arising from the use of the symbol in cartography to represent a village.] The hash sign (#), as it appears on the buttons of touch-tone telephones and some other keypads. 1974 Telephony 25 Feb. 16/1 A few months ago, a story traveled through the Bell System that the familiar symbol '#'..at long last had a name: 'octothorp'. 1975 Vancouver Province 15 Nov.

annote = {- NSW library logo: Hi Vince,Thanks for getting in touch so quickly! I don't know if you had a chance to read the interrobang articles already up at Shady Characters, but most of what I've written so far has been about the origins and early life of the interrobang. Given that it failed to catch on in the mainstream, I'm interested in the way that it seems to have become a sort of touchstone for those in the know about unusual punctuation.In the case of the NSW State Library logo, why did you choose the interrobang instead of creating an entirely new logo -The library was about to celebrate its 100th birthday. And wanted to mark it with a new identity and a repositioning across all it's communications and signage.We started by interviewing various stake holders and spent time going deep into the project. This informed our insight and helped us create the strategy based around 'surprising'. Not everything is on google and the physical act of the search is likely to uncover surprises. There is a massive wealth of content from Sydney's and Australia's history in the huge archives of this library.We tried many logos and differentlyWays of expressing this. Then I remembered the interrobang. What it represented was perfect for the library.You go there looking for answers and it's often a eureka moment when you discover the answer or an inspiration.did you expect people to recognise the symbol?Not really as its not a familiar symbol but it's pretty straight forward for anyone to understand it.Does the interrobang as a concept (as opposed to its visual appearance) have a particular relevance to the library? In terms of the design, did you take it from an existing font, or did you create a new symbol? Did you use any existing designs as a guide?We found a font called chronicle which was similar to typeface engraved on the building 100 years ago.I tweaked the logo until I was happy with the space and longevity of the mark.I realise these might all be a little vague and disjointed, but I'm just excited to have come across a use of the interrobang in real life, so to speak!I hope this helps.},

Believing that the best way to understand usage is to study it historically, Parkes focuses on how marks have actually been used. He cites examples from a wide range of literary texts from different periods and languages; the examples and plates also provide the reader with an opportunity to test Parkes's observations. This long-awaited book will no doubt stimulate debate among writers, editors, literary critics, philosophers, linguists, rhetoricians, and historians. It is destined to become a standard reference work for anyone interested in the history and use of language.},

@book{Lojek2007,
abstract = {When basic researchers started working on semiconductors during the late nineteen thirties and on integrated circuits at the end of the nineteen fifties, they did not know that their work would change the lives of future generations. Very few people at that time recognized the significance of, perhaps, the most important invention of the century. Historians have assigned the invention of integrated circuits to Jack Kilby and Robert Noyce. In this book, the author argues that the group of inventors was much larger. This richly illustrated account is a personal recollection of the development of integrated circuits and personalities - such as Russell Ohl, Karl Lark-Horovitz, William Shockley, Carl Frosch, Lincoln Derick, Calvin Fuller, Kurt Lehovec. Jean Hoerni, Sheldon Roberts, Jay Last, Isy Haas, Bob Norman, Dave Allison, Jim Nall, Tom Longo, Bob Widlar, Dave Talbert, Frank Wanlass, and Federico Faggin. Here is the first comprehensive behind-the-scenes account of the history of the integrated circuit, the microelectronics industry, and the people closely involved in the development of the transistor and the integrated circuit. "Your book is going to make a major contribution to semiconductor history. You and I agree that, while the world loves a hero, semiconductor progress depended on the efforts and ideas of a large number of people, and that moving forward depended on contributors going back a few decades in some cases. Also, as is the case with most inventions, a number of people with access to the same pool of common knowledge were working independently at the same time to put it all together and to make the necessary extensions to the existing technology and who realized that the time was right for society to accept the new concepts. Your diligent research points all of this out." Dr. Jay Last, Former Shockley Laboratories employee, co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor, co-founder of Amelco Semiconductor, and manager of Fairchild's group which designed and produced the world first planar integrated circuit. "Bo Lojek presents a remarkable document of the most important and significant technical development of our times. He describes in astounding detail the engineering efforts of modern microelectronics. He concentrates on the history of silicon semiconductor devices. California's "Silicon Valley" is the center of attention, together with its ancestry of transistor invention at Bell Laboratories. He has collected a wealth of illustrative documentation, gives incisive insight into the lives of the main actors and shows the often tragic fates of the engineers and businessmen. He does not hide his firm belief in the individual engineer and warns of the retarding influence of present-day political correctness." Dr. Hans J. Queisser, Former Shockley Semiconductor scientist and retired director of the Max-Planck-Institute for Solids, Stuttgart, Germany. "The technical history of the semiconductor history rivals the 1849 California Gold Rush as a period filled with excitement and opportunity. Although I cannot first hand validate its complete accuracy, I enthusiastically encourage you to read the collected facts, opinions, and views of an author who was actually part of this amazing period, viewing it as a successful practicing Engineer during this "gold rush"--Like hey-day of the semiconductor industry. For educators and technologists you will find this collection of data, facts, and opinions, collected and observed first hand by the author, fascinating! It is a tough read for others due to the writing experience of the author and its technical focus." John F. Gifford, Former Fairchild Semiconductor Marketing Manager of Linear Integrated Circuits, co-founder of Advanced Micro Devices, and President and Chief Executive Officer of Maxim Integrated Products. "Bo Lojek gets it right! There are few industries as dynamic as semiconductors and the history of the semiconductor industry is still unfolding. This book gives the history of people, places and technology that resulted in today's semiconductor industry. I particularly like the inclusion of many technical pieces in the book." Robert Dobkin, Former National Semiconductor Director of Advanced Circuit Development and co-founder and Chief Technical Officer of Linear Technology Corporation Research organization : Bell Telephone Laboratories -- Grown junction and diffused transistors -- Shockley Semiconductor Laboratories -- Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation : subsidiary of Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company -- Driving the company out of business -- Integrated circuits outside Fairchild Semiconductor -- Linear integrated circuits : pre-Widlar era prior to 1963 -- Robert J.

@article{Barsky2018Scrapers,
abstract = {Heavy-duty scrapers are documented as a specific morphotype in ancient African and Eurasian toolkits from the Oldowan into the Acheulian. They are characterized by a flat platform perpendicularly oriented to a carinated edge. The convex surface of that edge displays semi-peripheral, unidirectional removals associated with steep retouch and/or crush marks. This morphotype has been described from numerous sites covering a long temporal scale and are diversely referred to in French as “rostro-car{\'{e}}n{\'{e}}s” or “nucl{\'{e}}us-racloirs” and in English as “massive scrapers”, “core scrapers”, “large scrapers”, or “heavy end-scrapers”. Morpho-technological definitions and interpretations are reviewed to track the origin and evolution of heavy-duty scrapers over time and space. Results show that tools referred to as heavy-duty scrapers were made on thick cobbles during the Oldowan, and later, at the onset of the Acheulian, on Large Flakes, while smaller-sized items in Late Acheulian sites assume end-scraper morphologies. But should all of these tools really be grouped under a single denomination? Experimental work explores whether heavy-duty scrapers are the result of knapping processes, or if their morphology could be derived from other kinds of activities. Chronological continuity of the attributes specific to heavy-duty scrapers points to their role in ancient toolkits, suggesting that these scarce but ubiquitous primitive implements are, on equal footing with chopper-cores, one of the oldest morphotypes in the world.},

In medieval times, use changed to indicate an inappropriate space (in spaced writing) or a too-small space (in aerated writing). ---=note-separator=--- (private-note)- Hyphen, diastole et al adopted into Latin in the late 2nd or 3rd century AD when the Romans adopted scriptio continua in emulation of the Greeks (note 78) - No hyphens in Latin manuscripts (note 80)... - ...but it seems to recur in the early Middle Ages (7th, 8th c?) once word spaces are common.

According to interviews with key persons at NEC, T{\"{o}}shiba, and Fujitsu, IC firms' codevelopment with calculator and communication equipment companies greatly contributed to the strong competitiveness of the Japanese IC industry. However, the codevelopment between IC suppliers and their customers in the Japanese calculator markets also helps explain why the competitiveness of Japanese IC industry has been weakened since the late 1990s. The interfirm relations between Japanese IC suppliers and customers and its effects were not so simple and one-sided. The case of Japan's IC industry can be applied to other Japanese industries.},

In Righting the Mother Tongue, author David Wolman tells the cockamamie story of English spelling, by way of a wordly adventure from English battlefields to Google headquarters. Along the way, he joins spelling reformers picketing the national spelling bee, visits the town in Belgium—not England—where the first English books were printed, and takes a road trip with the boss at Merriam-Webster Inc. Wolman punctuates the journey with spelling wars waged by the likes of Samuel Johnson, Noah Webster, Theodore Roosevelt, and Andrew Carnegie.Rich with history, pop culture, curiosity, and humor, Righting the Mother Tongue explores how English spelling came to be, traces efforts to mend the code, and imagines the shape of tomorrow's words.},

abstract = {In this biography Anthony Everitt brings to life the world of ancient Rome in its glorious heyday. Cicero squared off against Caesar and was friends with young Brutus. He advised Pompey on his botched transition from military hero to politician. He lambasted Mark Antony and was the master of the smear campaign, as feared for his wit as he was for exposing his opponents' sexual peccadilloes. Brilliant, voluble, cranky, a terrible gossip, and a genius of political manipulation, Cicero was Rome's most revered politician, one of the greatest statesmen of all time.

abstract = {Some of the early superstitious beliefs concerning communication by means of magnets are mentioned. Some of the suggested 'static telegraphs' are described, together with the reasons for their failure. An account is given of the rise of the use of the electric current in the telegraph by continental workers early in the nineteenth century, and the manner in which this method became known in England. The work of Cooke and Wheatstone is briefly outlined, and the assistance given to the English workers by Joseph Henry. The development of the American telegraph in the hands of Morse is reviewed, and the similarity of the difficulties experienced by Morse and by Cooke. The origin of the relay is examined. The commercial success of the telegraph was largely due to the several needs it fulfilled, and the uses of the telegraph are enumerated. Submarine telegraphs and especially the Atlantic telegraph are described together with the mechanical and electrical difficulties associated with long distance telegraphy through cables. In this connection the work of William Thomson is very briefly reviewed. The growth of the telephone out of the telegraph at the hands of Bell in America is described, and is shown to be achieved as a result of the synthesis of Bell's knowledge of physiology and of electricity. The paper concludes with a statement of the commercial success of Bell's telephone.},

abstract = {In spite of the importance accorded the steam engine during nineteenth-century industrialization, little is known about its rate of diffusion and the determinants thereof in the United States. The primary purpose of this paper is to enhance our knowledge about the spread of this technology. New evidence on steam power use in 1820, 1850, and 1860, combined with published census data from 1870, permits quantitative estimates of the regional variations in timing, pace, and extent of usage before 1900. Second, we advance reasonable conjectures for the regional differences that appear. Although lack of evidence precludes a definitive delineation of causality, with simulation techniques we are able to use the limited evidence available on costs to reconcile, albeit imperfectly, the historical pattern with economic-theoretic predictions regarding the process of innovation.},

@article{DErrico2005,
abstract = {Since 1991, excavations at Blombos Cave have yielded a well-preserved sample of faunal and cultural material in Middle Stone Age (MSA) levels. The uppermost MSA phase, M1, is dated to c. 75 ka by optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and thermoluminescence, and the middle M2 phase to a provisional c. 78 ka. Artefacts unusual in a MSA context from these phases include bifacial points, bone tools, engraved ochre and engraved bone. In this paper, we describe forty-one marine tick shell beads recovered from these MSA phases and tick shell beads from Later Stone Age (LSA) levels at Blombos Cave and the Die Kelders site. Thirty-nine shell beads come from the upper M1 phase and two from M2. Morphometric, taphonomic and microscopic analysis of modern assemblages of living and dead tick shell demonstrate that the presence of perforated Nassarius kraussianus shells in the Blombos MSA levels cannot be due to natural processes or accidental transport by humans. The types of perforation seen on the MSA shells are absent on modern accumulations of dead shells and not attributable to post-depositional damage. Their location, size, and microscopic features are similar to those obtained experimentally by piercing the shell wall, through the aperture, with a sharp bone point. Use-wear, recorded on the perforation edge, the outer lip, and the parietal wall of the aperture indicates the shells having being strung and worn. MSA shell beads differ significantly in size, perforation type, wear pattern and shade compared to LSA beads and this eliminates the possibility of mixing across respective levels. Thirty-one beads were found in four groups of five to twelve beads, each group being recovered in a single square or in two adjacent sub-squares during a single excavation day. Within a group, shells display a similar shade, use-wear pattern and perforation size suggesting their provenance from the same beadwork item, lost or disposed during a single event. The likely symbolic significance of these finds suggests levels of cognitively modern behaviour not previously associated with MSA people. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

annote = {(private-note)As a graphic designer, the interrobang/interabang has always been on my radar as an unusual moment in the history of punctuation (and typography). When my partner Ian and I set up this company a little over a year ago we spent a long time thinking about a name that would mark us out as different whilst also hinting at the nature of what we do. Superficially we love the sound of the word interabang, and we also suspected (correctly) it would be a great ice breaker when meeting people — we either get into a conversation about what an interabang is, or (on occasion) people know what one is, and enjoy telling us about how they came across one. This is partly why we don't feature an actual interabang as part of our identity, as we wanted there to be a level of intrigue and 'discovery'. Conceptually we liked the idea of an interabang being two elements coming together to create something new (in the same way that my partner and I came together to start the company). It also suggests questions and answers, reminding us of the problem solving process we engage in as designers. Also, Adam explained their decision to use the less common 'interabang', rather than the more usual 'interrobang', and summed up neatly the benefits of choosing such an unusual (to non-Shady Characters readers, at least!) word for their name: Lastly, we chose the alternative spelling as we were concerned that people coming to the word cold, might find it harsh or aggressive (its only one letter away from having 'terror' in it!). As a company name interabang has worked really well for us — if you read the article from design week linked below it's the first thing mention[ed] about us. We've also found that people really engage with it — clients make up all sorts of names for us, and we've had a stream of home made/found interabang symbols sent to us. The most recent was iced onto a cake [ed: see above]!},

@incollection{Michelson2006Written,
abstract = {Trained as a printer when still a boy, and thrilled throughout his life by the automation of printing and the headlong expansion of American publishing, Mark Twain wrote about the consequences of this revolution for culture and for personal identity. Printer's Devil is the first book to explore these themes in some of Mark Twain's best-known literary works, and in his most daring speculations--on American society, the modern condition, and the nature of the self. Playfully and anxiously, Mark Twain often thought about typeset words and published images as powerful forces--for political and moral change, personal riches and ruin, and epistemological turmoil. In his later years, Mark Twain wrote about the printing press as a center of metaphysical power, a force that could alter the fabric of reality. Studying these themes in Mark Twain's writings, Bruce Michelson also provides a fascinating overview of technological changes that transformed the American printing and publishing industries during Twain's lifetime, changes that opened new possibilities for content, for speed of production, for the size and diversity of a potential audience, and for international fame. The story of Mark Twain's life and art, amid this media revolution, is a story with powerful implications for our own time, as we ride another wave of radical change: for printed texts, authors, truth, and consciousness.},

He was, without training, asked "What color/object [number]?" for collections of various simultaneously presented quantities (e.g., subsets of 4, 5, and 6 blocks of 3 different colors; subsets of 2, 4, and 6 keys, corks, and sticks). Accuracy was greater than 80% and was unaffected by array quantity, mass, or contour. His results demonstrated numerical comprehension competence comparable to that of chimpanzees and very young children. He also demonstrated knowledge of absence of quantity, using "none" to designate zero.},

The chronology and physical diversity of Pleistocene human fossils suggest that morphologically varied populations pertaining to the H. sapiens clade lived throughout Africa. Similarly, the African archaeological record demonstrates the polycentric origin and persistence of regionally distinct Pleistocene material culture in a variety of paleoecological settings. Genetic studies also indicate that present-day population structure within Africa extends to deep times, paralleling a paleoenvironmental record of shifting and fractured habitable zones. We argue that these fields support an emerging view of a highly structured African prehistory that should be considered in human evolutionary inferences, prompting new interpretations, questions, and interdisciplinary research directions.},

@book{Twain2010,
abstract = {Autobiography of Mark Twain READER'S EDITION Now Available! Half the Size, All the Twain! ISBN 978052027255"I've struck it!" Mark Twain wrote in a 1904 letter to a friend. "And I will give it away--to you. You will never know how much enjoyment you have lost until you get to dictating your autobiography." Thus, after dozens of false starts and hundreds of pages, Twain embarked on his "Final (and Right) Plan" for telling the story of his life. His innovative notion--to "talk only about the thing which interests you for the moment"--meant that his thoughts could range freely. The strict instruction that many of these texts remain unpublished for 100 years meant that when they came out, he would be "dead, and unaware, and indifferent," and that he was therefore free to speak his "whole frank mind." The year 2010 marks the 100th anniversary of Twain's death. In celebration of this important milestone and in honor of the cherished tradition of publishing Mark Twain's works, UC Press is proud to offer for the first time Mark Twain's uncensored autobiography in its entirety and exactly as he left it. This major literary event brings to readers, admirers, and scholars the first of three volumes and presents Mark Twain's authentic and unsuppressed voice, brimming with humor, ideas, and opinions, and speaking clearly from the grave as he intended.Editors:Harriet E. Smith, Benjamin Griffin, Victor Fischer, Michael B. Frank, Sharon K. Goetz, Leslie Myrick},

- Clemens asked to invest in the machine in 1879/1880 by Dwight Buell, a jeweller. Invests $2,000 with little hope of getting it back, because he "was always taking little chances like that; and almost always losing by it, too". Prescient!


- Machine that Twain saw could set and distribute type from a galley of "dead matter", but could not justify; this was done by an assistant. 3,000 ems an hour, or about 4 times faster than manual composition. Adds another $3,000.


- Clemens wrote that Paige was "a most extraordinary compound of business thrift and commercial insanity; of cold calculation and jejeune sentimentality; of veracity and falsehood; of fidelity and treachery; of nobility and baseness; of pluck and cowardice; of wasteful liberality and pitiful stinginess; of solid sense and weltering moonshine; of towering genius and trivial ambitions; of merciful bowels and a petrified heart; of colossal vanity."

The Franks were victorious, effectively halting the northward advance of Islam and preserving Christianity as the dominant faith in Europe.

@article{Derrico2012San,
abstract = {Recent archaeological discoveries have revealed that pigment use, beads, engravings, and sophisticated stone and bone tools were already present in southern Africa 75,000 y ago. Many of these artifacts disappeared by 60,000 y ago, suggesting that modern behavior appeared in the past and was subsequently lost before becoming firmly established. Most archaeologists think that San hunter–gatherer cultural adaptation emerged 20,000 y ago. However, reanalysis of organic artifacts from Border Cave, South Africa, shows that the Early Later Stone Age inhabitants of this cave used notched bones for notational purposes, wooden digging sticks, bone awls, and bone points similar to those used by San as arrowheads. A point is decorated with a spiral groove filled with red ochre, which closely parallels similar marks that San make to identify their arrowheads when hunting. A mixture of beeswax, Euphorbia resin, and possibly egg, wrapped in vegetal fibers, dated to ∼40,000 BP, may have been used for hafting. Ornaments include marine shell beads and ostrich eggshell beads, directly dated to ∼42,000 BP. A digging stick, dated to ∼39,000 BP, is made of Flueggea virosa . A wooden poison applicator, dated to ∼24,000 BP, retains residues with ricinoleic acid, derived from poisonous castor beans. Reappraisal of radiocarbon age estimates through Bayesian modeling, and the identification of key elements of San material culture at Border Cave, places the emergence of modern hunter–gatherer adaptation, as we know it, to ∼44,000 y ago.},

address = {Red Lion Court, Fleet Street},
annote = {Papyrus grows either in the marshes of Egypt, or in the sluggish waters of the river Nile, when they have overflowed and are lying stagnant, in pools that do not exceed a couple of cubits in depth. The root lies obliquely,1 and is about the thickness of one's arm; the section of the stalk is triangular, and it tapers gracefully upwards towards the extremity, being not more than ten cubits at most in height. Very much like a thyrsus2 in shape, it has a head on the top, which has no seed3 in it, and, indeed, is of no use whatever, except as a flower employed to crown the statues of the gods. The natives use the roots by way of wood, not only for firing, but for various other domestic purposes as well. From the papyrus itself they construct boats4 also, and of the outer coat they make sails and mats, as well as cloths, besides coverlets and ropes; they chew it also, both raw and boiled, though they swallow the juice only.The papyrus grows in Syria also, on the borders of the same lake around which grows the sweet-scented calamus;5 and King Antiochus used to employ the productions of that country solely as cordage for naval purposes; for the use of spartum6 had not then become commonly known. More recently it has been understood that a papyrus grows in the river Euphrates, in the vicinity of Babylon, from which a similar kind of paper may easily be produced: still, however, up to the present time the Parthians have preferred to impress7 their characters upon cloths1 Brachiali radicis oblique{\ae} crassitudine.2 This was a pole represented as being carried by Bacchus and his Bacchanalian train. It was mostly terminated by the fir cone, that tree being dedicated to Bacchus, in consequence of the use of its cones and turpentine in making wine. Sometimes it is surmounted by vine or fig leaves, with grapes or berries arranged in form of a cone.
3 This is not the fact: it has seed in it, though not very easily percep. tible. The description here given is otherwise very correct.
4 Among the ancients the term papyrus was used as a general appellation for all the different plants of the genus Cyperus, which was used for making mats, boats, baskets, and numerous other articles: but one species only was employed for making paper, the Cyperus papyrus, or Byblos. Fee states that the papyrus is no longer to be found in the Delta, where it formerly abounded.
5 See B. xii. c. 48.
6 Sometimes translated hemp. A description will be given of it in B. xix. c. 7.
7 "Intexere." This would almost appear to mean that they embroidered or interwove the characters. The Persians still write on a stuff made of white silk, gummed and duly prepared for the purpose.},

@article{Chen2017,
abstract = {Through consulting literature discussing the specific military function of beacon towers, this paper classified the architectural forms of 116 beacon towers of the Ming Great Wall in Qinghai province, and determined their distribution characteristics. According to related documents, their architectural forms can be divided into six types based on the relationship between their stage body and circumjacent buildings (the moat, enclosing wall and small flint) with spotty and linear distribution features. To further explain the linear distribution characteristics, the concept of a beacon tower link was used to illustrate the military intelligence routes and transmission orientation of the intelligence system of the Xining Guarding Post during the Ming Dynasty. By researching the change rule of the beacon tower elevations situated on such links, the authors found that most of these elevations have decreasing trends along their military intelligence orientation. In addition, beacon tower links closely surround the Xining Guarding Post with a radial shape, and they follow some important river systems and ancient roads. Many links follow the rule that beacon tower elevations can change suddenly at the corners where they are located, which reflects the wisdom of ancient Chinese architectural design.},

Drawing on the latest archaeological evidence and historical studies, the book examines the chronological development and technical details of handmills, beast mills, watermills and windmills from the first millennium BCE to c. 1500. It discusses the many and varied uses to which mills were turned in the civilisations of Rome, China, Islam and Europe, and the many types of mill that existed. The book also includes comparative regional studies of the social and economic signifance of milling, and tackles several important historiographical issues, such as whether technological stagnation was a characteristic of late Antiquity, whether there was an "industrial revolution" in the European Middle Ages based on waterpower, and how contemporary studies in the social shaping of technology can shed light on the study of pre-modern technology.},

@article{10.2307/74550,
abstract = {Historical development of the high strength Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys during the last 50 years reflects the influence of progressive changes in engineering and functional requirements related to the evolution of aircraft size, design concepts and manufacturing methods with consequent changes in dimensions and configurations of structure components. If the only criterion of merit for such application were high strength uncomplicated by stress-concentrating geometric factors or environmental influences, compositions available at least 40 years ago would have been highly suitable, since strength of the early materials fully equalled that of the alloys in use today. These early alloys were, however, not adequately resistant to stress-corrosion cracking even in the form of thin-section products such as sheet, thin extrusions and tube prevalent in aircraft of the earlier portion of the period. Development of the chromium-containing alloy 7075-T6 in the 1940s provided a solution to this problem for the thin-section products. As experience accumulated in extending the use of 7075-T6 to larger and thicker components produced from plate, thick-section extrusions or forgings, transverse direction stress-corrosion cracking was encountered along with decreasing strength and an undesired degree of mechanical anisotropy, particularly ductility. Alloy 7079, which had more uniform mechanical properties, enjoyed a transient period of popularity but proved to be even more deficient in resistance to stress-corrosion. The latter problem was eliminated with development of 7075-T73 involving use of a two-stage precipitation treatment with an accompanying significant strength penalty. Despite the strength trade-off, this material is extensively used in medium section thickness components of current large American aircraft and has an eminent success record. More highly alloyed compositions of this alloy family, 7178 and 7001, capable of developing higher strength than 7075-T6, appeared in the 1950s. The former is used in compressively stressed portions of wing structure but is not highly favoured for newer designs because of somewhat lower fracture toughness. The latter was considered deficient in this attribute and consequently not adopted for aircraft usage. Further developments based on 7075 include the T76 temper with high resistance to exfoliation corrosion and mechanical properties intermediate to those of the T6 and T73 temper products. Alclad 7075 employing a high strength cladding is used in certain large aircraft. More closely controlled variants of 7075, i.e. 7175 and 7475, coupled with special fabricating practices developed within the last 10 years are characterized by higher fracture toughness leading to increasing application. The newer alloys 7049 and 7050, introduced within the last 5 years, provide further advance in combinations of mechanical properties and environmental resistance resulting in adoption for retrofit programmes and inclusion in newly designed aircraft. Development and successful application of these materials in today's aircraft is a result of the persistent and systematic efforts of many scientists and engineers employing practical experimental and analytical methodology consistent with the Rosenhain tradition. The good record of reliability which these vehicles and materials have accumulated, and may confidently be expected to continue to accumulate, is a tribute to these people and their talents and dedication.},

abstract = {Smith Corona, formerly one of the world's leading manufacturers of typewriters, was challenged to exercise dynamic capability in the face of the dissipation of its main product category. A study of the last two decades of the life of the company shows how Smith Corona tried to alter its resource base by leveraging existing resources, creating new resources, accessing external resources, and releasing resources. Using the extended case method, this study advances dynamic capability theory by confronting it with an empirical case. The Smith Corona case provides rich insights into the resource alteration processes by which dynamic capability operates, and highlights resource cognition as a missing element in dynamic capability theory.

abstract = {Emojis have been widely used to simplify emotional expression and enrich user experience. As an interesting practice of ubiquitous computing, emojis are adopted by Internet users from many different countries, on many devices (particularly popular on smartphones), and in many applications. The "ubiq-uitous" usage of emojis enables us to study and compare user behaviors and preferences across countries and cultures. We present an analysis on how smartphone users use emojis based on a very large data set collected from a popular emoji keyboard. The data set contains a complete month of emoji usage of 3.88 million active users from 212 countries and regions. We demonstrate that the categories and frequencies of emojis used by these users provide rich signals for the identification and the understanding of cultural differences of smartphone users. Users from different countries present significantly different preferences on emojis, which complies with the well-known Hofstede's cultural dimensions model.},

@article{Kozowyk2017,
abstract = {The destructive distillation of birch bark to produce tar has recently featured in debates about the technological and cognitive abilities of Neandertals and modern humans. The abilities to precisely control fire temperatures and to manipulate adhesive properties are believed to require advanced mental traits. However, the significance given to adhesive technology in these debates has quickly outgrown our understanding of birch bark tar and its manufacture using aceramic techniques. In this paper, we detail three experimental methods of Palaeolithic tar production ranging from simple to complex. We recorded the fuel, time, materials, temperatures, and tar yield for each method and compared them with the tar known from the Palaeolithic. Our results indicate that it is possible to obtain useful amounts of tar by combining materials and technology already in use by Neandertals. A ceramic container is not required, and temperature control need not be as precise as previously thought. However, Neandertals must have been able to recognize certain material properties, such as adhesive tack and viscosity. In this way, they could develop the technology from producing small traces of tar on partially burned bark to techniques capable of manufacturing quantities of tar equal to those found in the Middle Palaeolithic archaeological record.},

abstract = {Flinders Petrie has been called the “Father of Modern Egyptology”—and indeed he is one of the pioneers of modern archaeological methods. This fascinating biography of Petrie was first published to high acclaim in England in 1985. Margaret S. Drower, a student of Petrie's in the early 1930s, traces his life from his boyhood, when he was already a budding scholar, through his stunning career in the deserts of Egypt to his death in Jerusalem at the age of eighty-nine. Drower combines her first-hand knowledge with Petrie's own voluminous personal and professional diaries to forge a lively account of this influential and sometimes controversial figure. Drower presents Petrie as he was: an enthusiastic eccentric, diligently plunging into the uncharted past of ancient Egypt. She tells not only of his spectacular finds, including the tombs of the first Pharaohs, the earliest alphabetic script, a Homer manuscript, and a collection of painted portraits on mummy cases, but also of Petrie's important contributions to the science of modern archaeology, such as orderly record-keeping of the progress of a dig and the use of pottery sherds in historical dating. Petrie's careful academic methods often pitted him against such rival archaeologists as Am{\'{e}}lineau, who boasted he had smashed the stone jars he could not carry away to be sold, and Maspero and Naville, who mangled a pyramid at El Kula they had vainly tried to break into.},

abstract = {On March 7, 1876, Alexander Graham Bell was granted U.S. Patent No. 174,465 for the speaking telegraph, or telephone, one of the most valuable patents in history. Attorneys for Bell and Elisha Gray had submitted their respective ideas for the telephone to the U.S. Patent Office three weeks earlier, incredibly, on the same day, 'Valentine's Day, February 14.' (The year 1876 should be assumed hereafter unless otherwise designated.) Gray was a successful inventor and cofounder of Western Electric Manufacturing Company, whereas Bell was a part-time inventor, a part-time private speech teacher for the deaf, and a teacher of elocution at Boston University. Bell's submission was a full patent application, however Gray's was a caveat, a document designed to protect an idea for one year, with a full application required within that time. If filed before a competing patent application, a caveat could lead to an expensive and prolonged Patent Office interference hearing to determine which inventor conceived of the idea first. Although both submissions contained similar descriptions of a liquid telephone transmitter (an early microphone), the Patent Office ruled that Bell's attorneys had filed a few hours before Gray's on February 14, and hence the patent was granted to Bell.},

The Franks were victorious, effectively halting the northward advance of Islam and preserving Christianity as the dominant faith in Europe.

Previous research suggests that clothing use originated anywhere between 40,000 and 3 Ma, though there is little direct archaeological, fossil, or genetic evidence to support more specific estimates. Since clothing lice evolved from head louse ancestors once humans adopted clothing, dating the emergence of clothing lice may provide more specific estimates of the origin of clothing use. Here, we use a Bayesian coalescent modeling approach to estimate that clothing lice diverged from head louse ancestors at least by 83,000 and possibly as early as 170,000 years ago. Our analysis suggests that the use of clothing likely originated with anatomically modern humans in Africa and reinforces a broad trend of modern human developments in Africa during the Middle to Late Pleistocene. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Author.},

Those two Steves, one now a billionaire and still at the head of Apple, not only succeeded with that product, but they also broke ground in the business world in ways few thought possible: They proved you could not only have fun at work, but pursuing a capitalist dream could be hip. How did Apple do it? How did it go from making computers that made a difference but not much of a dent in the overall market to creating a device (the iPod) and a music service (iTunes) that has changed the way we buy and experience music? And how did the Macintosh and its successors capture the hearts and minds of computer users so deeply that being a Mac person makes you a member of a special club? That's what this book is all about. As author Jason D. O'Grady shows, Apple is a rare company--one that is not afraid to think about a future that does not exist and turn it into reality. Critics have written Apple off time and again, yet it rises from the ashes to astound the critics and delight its customers. That's not luck or happenstance--it's vision, dedication, and persistence. Besides delighting Apple aficionados, this book will inspire students eager to launch a business career or work in the technology sector. Apple has never been afraid to chart its own path, and readers will learn what makes the company tick"--Provided by publisher.

@article{Owens2001Lean,
abstract = {Glendon Lean collated data on nearly 900 counting systems of Papua New Guinea, Oceania, and Irian Jaya (West Papua). Lean's data came from a questionnaire completed by students and talks with village elders. He read old documents written in English, German, and Dutch. He made comparisons between older and new accounts of the counting systems and compared neighbouring counting systems from both Austronesian and non-Austronesian languages. His work drew attention to the rich diversity of the systems and suggested that systems based on body parts and cyclic systems developed spontaneously. Digit tally systems were also relatively common. Lean's thesis on spontaneous developments of these ancient cultures challenged traditional theories describing the spread of number systems from Middle East cultures.},

@article{10.2307/2706808,
abstract = {Compared with Japan, no other industrialized country has so adamantly denied foreign investors direct access to its domestic markets. Japan continued to deny such market access until domestic constituencies finally championed foreign demands and successfully pressured a reluctant state for concessions. The initiative for these concessions came neither from Japan's principal government negotiators in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) nor from public policymakers in America. Rather, it came from American and other multinational corporations (MNCs) seeking to exploit imperfect markets for the technology and related assets which they alone controlled and which a few Japanese oligopolists demanded. These local oligopolists served as manipulative intermediaries between MNCs and the nation-state and in that position determined both the timing and the substance of their country's long march toward capital liberalization. Between the legislation of capital controls in 1950 and the de jure elimination of those controls in 1980, what began as an extension of limited concessions to individual MNCs, eventually aided by small regulatory loopholes, gradually encompassed all foreigners supplying broad product groups. During the intervening thirty years, the MNCs examined in this article--including Coca-Cola, IBM, Texas Instruments, and the "big three" U.S. automakers--finally gained limited access to the Japanese market. For them, the formal liberalizations of the late 1960s and early 1970s proved significant, but not always decisive, as Japanese oligopolists moved both to replace public regulations with private restrictions and to mesh their ongoing political influence domestically with their emerging economic power internationally. Thus, de facto liberalization proceeded slowly and unevenly, at least through 1980, and foreign direct investment in Japan continued to languish. What capital liberalization did occur had little to do with the pressures exerted on MITI and the Japanese state by the U.S. government and the international organizations that America then controlled. Rather, American diplomacy proved successful in forcing concessions from Japan only when it was backed up both by the economic power of American MNCs and by the active support of Japanese business.},
